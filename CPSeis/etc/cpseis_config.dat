!
!     Date        Author     Description
!     ----        ------     -----------
!33.  2009-06-11  Menger     Added CPSEIS_ARCH variable to be substituted.
!32.  2007-11-07  Goodger    Changed pbs server to lm11.
!31.  2004-09-07  SMCook     Changed value of LANDMARK_OWHOME_LINUX.
!30.  2004-06-18  SMCook     Changed value of LANDMARK_OWHOME_LINUX.
!29.  2004-06-10  Goodger    Set back to cpsdata_nodes.dat.
!28.  2004-05-19  Goodger    Set to use cpsdata_nodes_beta.dat.
!27.  2004-05-19  Goodger    Add keyword pfio_reserve_file_space_na.
!26.  2004-03-30  Goodger    Add keyword cps_template_dir.
!25.  2004-03-02  Goodger    Add keyword cps_pbs_type.
!24.  2004-02-17  Goodger    Change landmark_owhome_sol to /apps/ow from
!                            appl/ow.
!23.  2004-02-04  Goodger    Change rcp node to hoeplm05.
!22.  2004-02-03  Goodger    Change cpsacct_pbs_server1 to hoeplm05.
!21.  2004-01-26  Goodger    Add keyword for location.
!20.  2003-11-12  Goodger    Add platform_default parameters.
!19.  2003-09-02  SMCook     Removed jobmon variables (now stored elsewhere).
!                            Removed CPS runtime dependency on presence of the
!                             Landmark devkit, thereby eliminating several
!                             variables.
!                            Made LANDMARK_OW_HOME variable platform-dependent
!                             due to Landmark-on-Linux availability.
!18.  2003-08-05  SMCook     Changed LANDMARK_LM_LICENSE_FILE to 27000@globallm

!15.  2003-05-12  Goodger    Added keywords for batchtmp directory and 
!                            batchtmp nodes file.
!14.  2003-05-06  SMCook     Corrected values of bin_path.  Solaris version was
!                             plain wrong, Linux version relied on links.
!13.  2003-04-28  SMCook     Added new jobmon_pbs_queue_names B1390 and B1530.
!12.  2003-04-21  SMCook     Corrected value of LANDMARK_SWDEV_HOME.

!                            Added more nodes lists for jobmon configuration.
!10.  2003-04-01  SMCook     Jobmon keyword jobmon_pbs_queue_names added.
! 9.  2003-03-24  SMCook     Jobmon keywords added.  Also, note that there are
!                             plans to modify cnfg to allow the values of the
!                             variables to have whitespace (use quotes).
! 8.  2003-03-17  Goodger    Change keyword for cps_acct_pbs_server.
! 7.  2003-03-17  Goodger    Added revision history section.
