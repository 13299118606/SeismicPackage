-------------------------------------------------------
making program  cbyt  in  x86_64_intel91_lam
-------------------------------------------------------
ifort -nofor_main -i-static -o cbyt cbyt.o

----> LIBS          = MYLIBS  SPWSLIBS  CPSLIB
----> SYSLIBS       = SPS_LIBS  FOR_LIBS  GUI_LIBS  MATH_LIBS  JAVA_LIBS
----> OBJS_AND_LIBS = OBJS  MATH_LIBS  LIBS

Note: INTEL_LIBS is empty.
Note: FOR_LIBS is actually C++ libraries.
Note: Fortran libraries are not needed when linking with ifort (fortran compiler).
Note: C++ libraries are not needed if -cxxlib is added to the ifort command.

HERE IS THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF LIBRARIES LINKED IN:
----> link: SPWSLIBS
            OBJS_AND_LIBS  =  OBJS  MATH_LIBS  MYLIBS  SPWSLIBS  CPSLIB
            SYSLIBS        =  SPS_LIBS  FOR_LIBS  GUI_LIBS  MATH_LIBS  JAVA_LIBS
            SPWSLIBS
            CPSLIB
            FFTW_LIBS
            INTEL_LIBS
            MATH_LIBS
            MPI_LIBS
Note that SPWSLIBS is listed three times.
Note that MATH_LIBS is listed three times.
Note that CPSLIB is listed two times.

HERE IS A SIMPLER ORDER WHICH WORKS:
----> link: SPWSLIBS
            OBJS  MYLIBS  SPWSLIBS  SPWSLIBS
            CPSLIB
            SPS_LIBS
            FFTW_LIBS  FOR_LIBS  GUI_LIBS  JAVA_LIBS
            MPI_LIBS  MATH_LIBS
Note that SPWSLIBS is still listed three times.  Leaving any one of them out
causes undefined externals, apparently because there are circular dependencies,
and apparently there is something in OBJS which requires SPWSLIBS to precede
OBJ. although I have not researched this anomaly.
----
Note that the simpler order is specific to spws motif programs, since it uses
the library variables explicitly instead of the composite variables LIBS,
SYSLIBS, and OBJS_AND_LIBS which are set differently for non-motif and
non-spws programs.  The simpler order also eliminates the XDrawRectangle
unsatisfied external for msepita in the Woodlands and Park Row.  However,
the simpler order causes other system unsatisfieds on modi (Park Row).
Therefore the global fix is to keep the original more complicated and redundant
order, and to make it even more redundant by adding the X/motif libraries a
second time (at the end).

for cbyt etcetera on modi.

MOVED -lpthread -lc after libguide (above).
ORIGINALLY, -lpthread -lc was before libguide, which required MATH_LIBS
to be listed twice to satisfy unsatisfied externals.
