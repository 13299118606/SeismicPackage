         HOW_TO_MAKE_CPSEIS  in  $CPSEIS_HOME         21 June 2011 

CHECKOUT
To check out CPSeis from the svn repository, execute the following:

          svn co https://cpseis.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cpseis/trunk cpseis

SET_ENVIRONMENT
To set up the CPSeis environment, something like the following should reside
in your ~/.bashrc file (with possible variations depending on the machine),
or in a separate script which you source either from your ~/.bashrc file,
or manually:

          export CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR=/home/bmenger/workspace/cpseis-trunk
          export THIRDPARTY_DIR=/apps/thirdparty
          unset CPSEIS_ENVIRONMENT
          source $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/etc/cpseis_bashrc.sh mpich2 gfortran

Note that $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR must be the toplevel directory you checked out.
Note also that $CPSEIS_HOME will be set to the same as $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR.

THIRD_PARTY_DEPENDENCIES
The build and make will only work if you previously have set up the THIRDPARTY_DIR and put into it a java distribution, fftw, and mpich2 or lam MPI.  If these reside elsewhere, then you need to "fake it" by putting links in a directory pointed to by the THIRDPARTY_DIR environment variable.  An example follows:
if your jdk is in /usr/local/jdk , your fftw is in /opt/fftw, your mpich2 is in /opt/mpi/mpich2, then you could 
mkdir -p /apps/thirdparty
mkdir -p /apps/thirdparty/fftw/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH
mkdir -p /apps/thirdparty/jdk/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH
mkdir -p /apps/thirdparty/mpich2/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH
ln -s /usr/local/jdk /apps/thirdparty/fftw/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH 
ln -s /opt/fftw /apps/thirdparty/jdk/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH
ln -s /opt/mpi/mpich2 /apps/thirdparty/mpich2/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH
export THIRDPARTY_DIR=/apps/thirdparty

Now the packages in CPSEIS will find the appropriate libraries to do the builds.Alternatively, you can use the build scripts in CPSEIS_HOME/scripts to build fftw, mpich2, and java jdk.(jdk will require you to go to sun.com and download the bin file.)

MAKE
	cd $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/scripts
	chmod 755 *
	./create_directories $CPSEIS_ARCH
	unset CPSEIS_ENVIRONMENT
	. ~/.bashrc
	cd ../platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH
	./create_directories $CPSEIS_ARCH
	make depend all install cfe 
	cd ../../spws_home/making
	./add_new_platform $CPSEIS_ARCH
	cd $CPSEIS_ARCH
	make 
	make programs
	fixhelp.sh

(now go down to CONFIGURING CPSEIS)

If we get the install script fixed right, then...the following will work.

To make everything in CPSeis, you can go to the $CPSEIS_HOME/scripts directory
and execute the following script:

              ./install_cpseis

The above script will do the following (in this order):

(1) Create any required directories (including platform-specific directories).
(2) Make targets in $CPSEIS_HOME/src.
(3) Make targets in $CPSEIS_HOME/opencfe.
(4) Make targets in $CPSEIS_HOME/wrappers.
(5) Make targets in $CPSEIS_HOME/spws_home.

After that, execute make in any the following directories (as appropriate):

(1) $CPSEIS_HOME/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH.
(2) $CPSEIS_HOME/wrappers.
(3) $CPSEIS_HOME/wrappers/src/org/cpseis.
(4) $CPSEIS_HOME/wrappers/src/org/cpseis/wwwwww.
(5) $CPSEIS_HOME/spws_home/making/$CPSEIS_ARCH.
(6) $CPSEIS_HOME/spws_home/ssssss/zzzzzz/$CPSEIS_ARCH.

      wwwwww = util or wrappers or examples
      ssssss = util or oop or programs
      zzzzzz = subdirectory under util or oop or programs.

CONFIGURING CPSEIS:

To fix cps_config.dat (for config and lock files etc):

(1) Delete the file $CPSEIS_HOME/etc/$CPSEIS_ARCH/cps_config.dat.
(2) Source your ~/.bashrc file.
(3) rm -rf $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/log/
(4) mkdir -p $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/log
(5) touch $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/log/cps_lockfile.dat
(6) READ and add appropriate directories for file storage for:
    (a) $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/etc/cpsdata_nodes.dat
    (b) $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/etc/cpstemp_nodes.dat
(you will need to create some directories to hold extents of files, similar to
what promax does (but better :^) ):
(7) put a batchtmp directory in $CPSEIS_INSTALL_DIR/etc/cfebld_batchtmp_dirs where you want your temporary batch jobs to be built.  Failed jobs will stay here for diagnoses, but completed successful jobs will auto-delete.
You will need a directory /ptmp with some space on it if you don't do anything to these files, that is where I put the default.
mkdir -p /ptmp/localhost/scratch
mkdir -p /scratch/ptmp

Note that the above fix for cps_config.dat should no longer be required because
that file has been removed from the svn repository so it will automatically get
remade without the user having to delete it manually.

To make cfe:

(1) Type "make cfe" in $CPSEIS_HOME/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH.
(2) Type "make install" in $CPSEIS_HOME/platforms/$CPSEIS_ARCH.
(3) Delete $CPSEIS_HOME/etc/$CPSEIS_ARCH/cps_config.dat (which will get remade
     by setup_cpseis_environment, which is called from cpseis_bashrc.sh).
(4) Source your ~/.bashrc file.
