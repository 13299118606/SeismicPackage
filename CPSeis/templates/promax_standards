The name of the program should be cop_name-of-program.
  Therefore, for program xp

    The directory under port/src/exe will be cop_xp
    The menu file will be                    cop_xp.menu
    The help file will be                    cop_xp.help OR cop_xp.doc




Your program should have a version.

Each program should have a parameter called versn which is invisible to
the user.  The main logic should check that the menu versn is what is
expected.  The version is in date formate, e.g. 070405.  The version should
be changed for each update.


Source code and help files should be put into a template.

Templates are found in /home/sps/templates

  promax_program_template     - template for main logic
  promax_auxiliary_template   - template for other source code files
  promax_header_file_template - template for header files
  promax_help_template        - template for the help file




When new code is checked in...

  You must provide...
     Makefile and .help (or .doc) file as well as the source code.

  Change the versn parameter to a new version

  Add a revision history entry.

  Change the date in the brief doc section.
