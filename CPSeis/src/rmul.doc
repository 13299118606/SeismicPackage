RadonDemultiple removes multiple events from CMP gathers through use of parabolic,  
linear, or hyperbolic RADON transforms to model multiples and subtract them 
from the original data.  RadonDemultiple operation follows these steps.

      1.  Transform CMP gather to parabolic, linear, or hyperbolic RADON 
          space.

      2.  Identify events with residual moveout in CMPs between RMO_PRI_MIN
          and RMO_PRI_MAX as primaries and mute (zero) them in the transformed
          data.  (This protects the primaries.)

      3.  Identify events with residual moveout in CMPs between RMO_MUL_MIN
          and RMO_MUL_MAX as multiples and mute out everything else from
          parabolic, linear, or hyperbolic RADON space. (Taper the mute from 
          0.0 at RMO_PRI_MAX to 1.0 at RMO_MUL_MIN.)

      4.  Transform the energy that is identified as multiple energy back
          from parabolic, linear, or hyperbolic RADON space and subtract it 
          from the original CMP gather.

The parabolic, linear, or hyperbolic RADON transform is optimized by 
least-squares to accurately model the phases and amplitudes of multiples in 
noisy data with limited or irregularly sampled offsets.

Parabolic and hyperbolic Scans

RadonDemultiple assumes that events on input CMPs, with primary velocity 
NMO correction applied, have a sufficiently small residual moveout such that they
have an approximately parabolic or hyperbolic contour.  Thus, if primaries and 
multiples have non-overlapping residual moveout on CMPs (and reasonably 
uniform amplitude and phase), then RadonDemultiple can perform a RADON transform and 
be able to separate primaries from multiples in parabolic or hyperbolic 
RADON space.

Linear Scans

The linear Radon does not require the input CMPs to have primary velocity 
NMO correction applied.

The high-resolution Radon transform follows the sparseness constraints of
Sacchi and Ulrych's paper (1995). This implementation uses frequency 
independent sparseness constraints which is an average of Sacchi's frequency 
dependent Radon solution over a frequency range. Within this frequency
range, the signals should have the highest amplitudes. The advantage  
of using the average of the sparseness contraints is that they can focus
and preserve the transform amplitude better than the original Sacchi's 
approach, but it adds more computational time to precompute the average 
of the sparseness constraints.
