#           Wbox_help                    revised  26 July 1996

#  Help for windowboxes (data entry windows created using the wbox routines
#  on library wboxlib.a).

#  The contents of this file should be copied into in the application's
#  context-sensitive help file.  Overview help on keys is displayed 
#  whenever the user presses CTRL-HELP or CTRL-F1 or CTRL-PF1.
#  Context-sensitive help is optionally displayed when the user's pointer
#  gets into the general message area or the array index area at the bottom 
#  of the windowbox.  Context-sensitive help is also displayed for the 
#  transient datafields used for finding an array index or an array value.

#  You should also include context-sensitive help in this file, for all
#  datafields in your windowbox (except prompt names or other fields
#  with switch variable zero).  To do this, use identifiers typed as
#  follows:
#                        help*boxname_ident:
#
#  where boxname = the name specified in the call to wbox_create2 or
#                    dbox_create2 or fbox_create2,
#    and ident   = the identification integer specified in the
#                    registration call for the variable.
# 
#    (Help can also be displayed for prompts associated with a variable,
#    if the switch variable for the prompt is not zero.  In this case,
#    the identification integer is the negative of that for the variable.)
 

help*wbox_find_index:\
----------------------ARRAY INDEX TO FIND-----------------------------\n\
Type here the array index you wish to go to.  The array (or arrays)\n\
will be scrolled if necessary.  If you just press RETURN or another non-\n\
printable key, you will be transferred to the VALUE field at the right\n\
(if the windowbox is wide enough to show it), where you will be able to\n\
choose an array value rather than an array index.

 
help*wbox_find_value:\
----------------------ARRAY VALUE TO FIND-----------------------------\n\
Type here the array value you wish to go to.  The array (or arrays)\n\
will be scrolled if necessary.  If the array is a numeric array, you will\n\
go to the nearest value in the array.  If the array is a character string\n\
array, you will go the the value for which there is the greatest number\n\
of beginning matching characters.

 
help*wbox_message_line:\
----------------------GENERAL MESSAGE AREA----------------------------\n\
Transient messages are displayed in this line.  When there are no messages,\n\
the type of the active datafield is displayed.  If the active datafield\n\
is a numeric or text entry field, the current input mode is displayed.  This\n\
input mode, and the exact location to edit, can be changed by using the\n\
shifted arrow keys, or by repeatedly pressing mouse button 1.  Press\n\
CTRL-HELP, CTRL-PF1, or CTRL-F1 for a description of all special action keys.

 
help*wbox_index_line:\
----------------------ARRAY INDEX MESSAGE AREA------------------------\n\
When the active datafield is the element of an array, the array index,\n\
and the length of the array, are shown in this line.  If you wish to\n\
go to a specific array index or array value, you can press FIND or CTRL-F.\n\
This action will temporarily display datafields on this line where you\n\
can make your choice.  Press CTRL-HELP, CTRL-PF1, or CTRL-F1 for a\n\
description of all special action keys.

---------------------------DEFINITIONS--------------------------------\n\
\n\
A WINDOWBOX is a special rectangular area in a Motif dialog box or main\n\
   window.  This rectangular area, outlined with a 5-pixel-wide black\n\
   border, is used primarily for displaying and editing arrays of numbers.\n\
   This help describes common features of all windowboxes.  A windowbox\n\
   contains one or more datafield groups, each of which contains one or\n\
   more datafields. It also displays one or two message lines at the bottom.\n\
   One or more windowboxes, and possibly text fields or buttons which\n\
   are not part of any windowbox, may reside in the same dialog box or\n\
   main window.  The buttons along the bottom of a dialog box are not part\n\
   of any windowbox.\n\
\n\
A DATAFIELD is an individual text field (into which the user might be able\n\
   to enter text or numbers), or a pushbutton, a toggle button, or a radio\n\
   button.  These text fields and buttons look and behave similarly to\n\
   Motif widgets.\n\
\n\
A DATAFIELD GROUP is either a set of linked arrays, or the set of all\n\
   datafields which are not part of any array.  It is similar to a\n\
   Motif "tab group".\n\
\n\
A SET OF LINKED ARRAYS consists of one or more side-by-side columns of\n\
   datafields, where each column is an array.  All arrays in such a set\n\
   always have the same number of array elements.  These arrays can be\n\
   scrolled together (using a scrollbar or special keys) to bring into view\n\
   all elements of the arrays.\n\
\n\
----------------------MOVING FROM FIELD TO FIELD----------------------\n\
\n\
Use mouse button 1 to move to any datafield.  It can also be used to\n\
scroll a set of linked arrays using the normal actions of a scrollbar.\n\
\n\
Use ARROW keys to move up, down, left, or right to adjacent datafields\n\
within the same datafield group.  Arrays will scroll as necessary.\n\
The ENTER key will do the same thing as the last ARROW key used.\n\
\n\
Use TAB or SHIFT-TAB to move into or out of the windowbox to/from other\n\
parts of the dialog box.  This is a standard Motif action.\n\
\n\
Use TAB or SHIFT-TAB or F20 or SHIFT-F20 or CTRL-T to move from one\n\
datafield group to another within the windowbox.\n\
\n\
  [For keymode 2 (see CTRL-S below), you must use TAB and SHIFT-TAB\n\
  (instead of LEFT and RIGHT) to move left or right to adjacent datafields\n\
  within a datafield group, rather than from one datafield group to another.]\n\
\n\
  [Keymode 3 disables the use of TAB and SHIFT-TAB for any purpose within\n\
  the windowbox because of the Motif action which may also occur.]\n\
\n\
Use CTRL-ARROW or SHIFT-CTRL-ARROW to move to top, bottom, left edge, or\n\
right edge within a datafield group.  In arrays, the SHIFT-CTRL-UP and\n\
SHIFT-CTRL-DOWN keys cause movement to the very beginning or end of the\n\
arrays (scrolling as necessary), whereas the CTRL-UP (or PREV) and\n\
CTRL-DOWN (or NEXT) keys scroll one screen-full at a time.\n\
\n\
------------------EDITING WITHIN A TEXT DATA FIELD--------------------\n\
\n\
Use mouse button 1 to move within a text datafield, and to change between\n\
replace, insert, and overstrike text entry modes.  The current mode is\n\
shown in a message area at the bottom.  For replace and overstrike modes,\n\
highlighted text will be replaced when the next printable key is pressed.\n\
For insert mode, text pushed off the right is lost.\n\
\n\
Alternately, use SHIFT-LEFT and SHIFT-RIGHT to move within a text datafield.\n\
     [For keymode 2 (see CTRL-S below), you can also use LEFT and RIGHT\n\
     for this purpose.]\n\
\n\
Alternately, use SHIFT-UP or SHIFT-DOWN to change between replace, insert,\n\
and overstrike text entry modes.\n\
\n\
Use the DELETE key to delete a character to the left of the curser. \n\
If all characters are deleted, the previous value reappears.\n\
\n\
-------------------MISCELLANEOUS SPECIAL ACTION KEYS------------------\n\
\n\
Use mouse button 1 (or RETURN or SELECT) to activate the highlighted\n\
     pushbutton or toggle button or radio button.\n\
Use DO (or CTRL-D) to undo the most recently typed value, and to toggle\n\
     between the last two values.\n\
Use HELP (or PF1 or F1) to activate context-sensitive help, which will be\n\
     displayed for each field as it becomes active, and for all fields swept \n\
     over by the pointer (with or without holding down a mouse button).\n\
Use CTRL-HELP (or CTRL-PF1 or CTRL-F1) to get this help on keys.\n\
Use CTRL-[an integer] to choose a debug mode (same as resource wboxdebug).\n\
\n\
-----------------SPECIAL OPTIONS WITHIN ARRAY FIELDS------------------\n\
\n\
Use FIND (or CTRL-F) to go to a desired index or value in the current column.\n\
     The closest match will be found.\n\
Use CTRL-M to find the next matching value in the current column.\n\
Use CTRL-N to find the next non-matching value in the current column.\n\
Use CTRL-V to find ANY value which matches ANY OTHER in the current column.\n\
Use REMOVE (or CTRL-R) to remove a row and put it into the row-buffer.\n\
Use INSERT (or CTRL-I) to insert a row from the row-buffer.\n\
     If the row-buffer is empty, or contains a row from a different set of\n\
     linked arrays, or the array index of the current row does not match\n\
     the array index previously saved, the inserted row is set to nils.\n\
Use CTRL-P (paste) like INSERT, except the current row does not have to\n\
     match the saved row.  This enables moving rows from one row to another.\n\
Use CTRL-C (clear) to clear the row-buffer to nils.\n\
The current index, and the maximum current number of indices, are shown \n\
     in a message area at the bottom.\n\
You can resize this dialog box by grabbing its border with the mouse, to \n\
     increase or decrease the number of rows and columns visible.  This is \n\
     particularly useful when you have a long set of linked arrays, or a \n\
     bunch of columns on the right which are not currently needed. \n\
In some applications, the keys for inserting and removing rows might work\n\
     slightly differently from the above description.\n\
\n\
---------------ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO USE ARROW AND TAB KEYS--------------\n\
\n\
Use CTRL-S (referred to above) to toggle between three keymodes for using\n\
   arrow and tab keys (corresponding to values of the resource wboxkeymode):\n\
\n\
wboxkeymode 1 (most similar to EZED, and to Motif style for buttons):      \n\
  to move within a datafield:        SHIFT-LEFT   SHIFT-RIGHT              \n\
  to move to another datafield:      LEFT         RIGHT                    \n\
  to move between datafield groups:  F20  SHIFT-F20  CTRL-T  TAB  SHIFT-TAB\n\
\n\
wboxkeymode 2 (most similar to Motif style for text):                      \n\
  to move within a datafield:         SHIFT-LEFT  SHIFT-RIGHT  LEFT  RIGHT \n\
  to move to another datafield:       TAB   SHIFT-TAB                      \n\
  to move between datafield groups:   F20   SHIFT-F20   CTRL-T             \n\
\n\
wboxkeymode 3 (reduces conflict between windowboxes and Motif):            \n\
  to move within a datafield:         SHIFT-LEFT   SHIFT-RIGHT             \n\
  to move to another datafield:       LEFT         RIGHT                   \n\
  to move between datafield groups:   F20   SHIFT-F20   CTRL-T             \n\
\n\
----------------------------RESOURCES---------------------------------\n\
\n\
The following resource be set for tables in an app-defaults file,\n\
or in your own .Xdefaults table.  The examples shown are commonly-\n\
used defaults (although not necessarily the defaults in this program).\n\
\n\
The font resource and color resources may have to be customized for\n\
different X-window servers and for individual preferences.\n\
On gray-scale monitors, the colors automatically change to shades of gray.\n\
On black-white monitors, the colors automatically change to black or white.\n\
\n\
To change any resource, just add lines like these examples to your\n\
.Xdefaults file in your home directory, and then load the file into\n\
your server by typing xrdb .Xdefaults.  (The information in parentheses\n\
should not be typed.)\n\
\n\
\n\
*wboxdebug:  0    (0 = no debug print, 1 = standard debug print,\n\
                               2 = extensive debug print, 3 = very extensive)\n\
                              (also changable with the CTRL-0, CTRL-1, CTRL-2,\
 and CTRL-3 keys)\n\
\n\
*wboxtiny:  0   (0 = invisible tiny pushbutton, needed for technical reasons)\n\
                          1 or more = visible tiny pushbutton of\
 indicated size for debug purposes)\n\
\n\
*wboxkeymode:   1    (1 = use arrow keys to move left and right,\n\
                                    2 = use TAB and SHIFT-TAB to move\
 left and right,\n\
                                    3 = like 1 except TAB and SHIFT-TAB\
 not used at all)\n\
                                   (also changable with the CTRL-S key)\n\
\n\
*wboxscrollbars:   2        (0 = no scrollbars, 1 = as needed, 2 = always)\n\
\n\
*wboxscrollwidth:   17        (width of scrollbars in pixels)\n\
\n\
*wboxmaxrows:      10   (maximum number of array rows to initially display)\n\

\n\
*wboxbottomshadow: black     (bottom shadow of pushbutton, top of textbox)\n\
\n\
*wboxnormaltext:   black       (color of most text)\n\
\n\
*wboxdimtext:      gray40      (color of dimmed-out text)\n\
\n\
*wboxenterbox:     red   (color of small rectangle around field with focus)\n\
\n\
*wboxmessagetext:  white       (color of most messages in message areas)\n\
\n\
*wboxmessageloud:  blue      (color of important messages in message areas)\n\
\n\
*wboxmessagebox:   black       (color of box around message areas)\n\
\n\
NOTE REGARDING GRAY COLORS:\n\
The color "black" is the same as "gray0".\n\
The color "white" is the same as "gray100".\n\
The color "gray" might be similar to as "gray50" or "gray75".\n\
You can specify any shade of gray by using the name "gray" appended\n\
by any integer between 0 and 100.\n\

For HORIZONTAL CHAINING, DIST is a horizontal distance corresponding to\n\
   changes in the XLOC and YLOC coordinates only.\n\
For SLOPE CHAINING, DIST is a sloping distance corresponding to changes\n\
   in the XLOC and YLOC coordinates, and changes in ELEV (the elevation).\n\
For NO CHAINING, the DIST column will remain blank, except when showing\n\
   interpolated values (i.e. the horizontal distance values which will\n\
   be calculated on the Cray from XLOC and YLOC).\n\
Blank values in this field will be interpolated by downward repetition.\n\

between flags.\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST is zero, this column will show a zero for the first\n\
flag on the line.\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST is positive or negative, this column will show a value\n\
which might be different from zero for the first flag on the line.\n\
This first value will be a multiple of FIXDIST; it will be equal\n\
to zero or greater than zero if everything is OK, or less than zero\n\
if the line does not match appropriately.\n\
The line will not match appropriately if its shotpoint increment\n\

\n\
If FIXDIST is zero, this column will show a zero for the first\n\
flag on the line.\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST is positive or negative, this column will show a value\n\
which might be different from zero for the first flag on the line.\n\
This first value will be a multiple of FIXDIST; it will be equal\n\

other lines.\n\
\n\
Normally, trace header words 17 and 18 contain the true X and Y\n\
midpoint coordinates.  However, if FIXDIST is positive, header\n\
word 17 will be derived from this value (appropriately skidded)\n\
for the source and receiver of the trace, using FIXDIST as the\n\

################ flag

help*rp_table_4:\
This variable specifies whether the trace numbers in the shot profile change\n\
fastest in the inline (X) direction or in the crossline (Y) direction.  You\n\
must specify X or Y in this field.  The choice is irrelevant unless both\n\
#X and #Y are greater than one (that is, you have a rectangular array of\n\
receivers).\n\
\n\
Two additional FLAG options are available (FLAG=SKIP and FLAG=DUP) to\n\
facilitate describing two particular types of situations where the LD cards\n\
are used in an irregular manner in some shot profiles.\n\
\n\
To handle these cases, one or more additional RP cards can\n\
be built for a given pattern number, in addition to the card(s) with FLAG=X\n\
and/or FLAG=Y.  By setting FLAG=SKIP or FLAG=DUP, you can specify a shotpoint\n\
(and corresponding line number) which will be either skipped, or used twice,\n\
in the receiver spread (as if you had a missing or duplicate LD card).  The\n\
specified location must exist on an LD card.  Note that when you set\n\
FLAG=SKIP or FLAG=DUP, the shotpoint and line number will be ACTUAL\n\
locations rather than dummy or relative locations, and that all columns\n\
to the right of these will be irrelevant.\n\
\n\
You may want to use FLAG=SKIP to handle the case where a particular\n\
shotpoint was not used (skipped over) while laying out receivers,\n\
such that adjacent channels were recorded by receivers on each side of this\n\
shotpoint.  The receiver pattern described by the other RP cards with the\n\
same pattern number will automatically skip over this location.\n\
\n\
You may want to use FLAG=DUP to handle the case where\n\
a particular shotpoint was used twice while laying out receivers,\n\
such that two adjacent channels were recorded at the same\n\
shotpoint.  The receiver pattern described by the other RP cards with the\n\
same pattern number will automatically use this location twice.\n\

The only time this number means anything is when you have more than one\n\
Receiver Pattern card with the same Receiver Pattern number.  In such a case,\n\
subsequent Receiver Pattern cards are related to the first card by the\n\
difference in the shotpoints.\n\

This parameter is irrelevant if FLAG=SKIP or FLAG=DUP.\n\



################ spacing between receivers in inline direction

help*rp_table_8:\
XINC is the spacing between receivers, measured in LD card intervals.  In\n\
   other words, XINC is an integer (positive, negative, or zero) which \n\

   receiver to the next.\n\
For example, if the LD shotpoint interval is 0.5 and the receiver shotpoint\n\
   interval is 1.0, you must specify XINC=2.\n\
This parameter is irrelevant if FLAG=SKIP or FLAG=DUP.\n\



################ number of receivers in crossline direction

help*rp_table_9:\
#Y is the number of receivers oriented in the crossline direction (at \n\
the same shotpoint but on different lines) beginning at the specified \n\

Note that this direction is not necessarily in the Y direction.\n\
This parameter is irrelevant if FLAG=SKIP or FLAG=DUP.\n\



################ spacing between receivers in crossline direction

help*rp_table_10:\
YINC is the spacing between receivers, measured in line intervals.  In other\n\
   words, XINC is an integer (positive, negative, or zero) which specifies\n\
   how many lines we must move in order to go from one receiver to the next.\n\
For example, if one receiver is on line 7 and the next receiver is on line 5,\n\
   you must specify YINC=-2.\n\
This parameter is irrelevant if FLAG=SKIP or FLAG=DUP.\n\



################ pattern skid in inline direction

   A positive number is a skid to the left, when facing toward the\n\
   next (increasing) LD card location.\n\
Note that these skids are NOT generally in the X and Y directions.\n\
Note that these skids actually relate to a particular channel number\n\
   (or trace number) in a shot profile, and not to actual receiver ground\n\
   positions; therefore these skids are rarely used.\n\

FIXDIST is the fixed inline distance increment.  If FIXDIST is\n\
  not zero, several things happen for each line:\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST>0 or FIXDIST<0:\n\
   (1) The actual inline distance to each flag is replaced by a\n\
  regularized measurement, such that the distance from flag to\n\
  flag (from one LD card to the next) is assumed equal to the\n\
  absolute value of FIXDIST.\n\
   (2) If there is more than one line, the inline coordinates of\n\
  all flags on all lines are set to values that will match up the\n\
  shotpoints of all the lines, such that the minimum inline\n\
  coordinate will be zero.  This will give sensible results only\n\
  if the shotpoint increment is the same for all lines.\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST>0:\n\
   (1) The CMP X-coordinate is replaced by the (now fixed) "center"\n\

   (2) The "nearest" CMP shotpoint and elevation are replaced by\n\
  the "center" CMP shotpoint and elevation.\n\
   (3) The sequential ground position is set so that matching\n\

overview*HEADER_POP:\
\n\
This table shows CPS trace headers calculated from the field geometry.\n\
\n\
\n\
The following definitions might be helpful:\n\
\n\
SEQUENTIAL GROUND POSITION - This is the LD card number.  If\n\
  FIXDIST is positive, this is set differently, as described\n\
  below.\n\
\n\
INLINE DISTANCE - The distance measured along the (possibly\n\
  crooked) line, beginning with a value of zero for the first\n\
  flag on that line.  If FIXDIST is not zero, this inline\n\
  distance is altered as described below.\n\
\n\
NEAREST CMP quantity - The quantity corresponds to a point on the\n\
  (possibly crooked) line closest to the true (X,Y) midpoint,\n\
  which may not actually fall on the line.\n\
\n\
CENTER CMP quantity - The quantity corresponds to a point halfway\n\
  between the source and receiver as measured along the (possibly\n\
  crooked) line.  The location of this point is specified by the\n\
  average of the source and receiver inline distances.  However,\n\
  if the source and/or receiver of a trace have skids large\n\
  enough to put them closer to different flags, these quantities\n\
  will be calculated as if the source and/or receiver were at those\n\
  closer flags.  (This allows the trace to fall into the middle of\n\
  the correct CMP bin when a fixed inline distance is requested.)\n\
\n\
FIXDIST is the fixed inline distance increment.  If FIXDIST is\n\
  not zero, several things happen for each line:\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST>0 or FIXDIST<0:\n\
   (1) The actual inline distance to each flag is replaced by a\n\
  regularized measurement, such that the distance from flag to\n\
  flag (from one LD card to the next) is assumed equal to the\n\
  absolute value of FIXDIST.\n\
   (2) If there is more than one line, the inline coordinates of\n\
  all flags on all lines are set to values that will match up the\n\
  shotpoints of all the lines, such that the minimum inline\n\
  coordinate will be zero.  This will give sensible results only\n\
  if the shotpoint increment is the same for all lines.\n\
\n\
If FIXDIST>0:\n\
   (1) The CMP X-coordinate is replaced by the (now fixed) "center"\n\
  CMP inline distance, and the CMP Y-coordinate is set to 0.\n\
   (2) The "nearest" CMP shotpoint and elevation are replaced by\n\
  the "center" CMP shotpoint and elevation.\n\

To reset the temporary transform to match the actual transform, press RESET\
 or CANCEL.\n\
\n\
\n\
------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
\n\
HERE IS ONE SUGGESTED WAY TO DERIVE A GRID TRANSFORM FOR YOUR DATASET\n\
GRAPHICALLY, WITHOUT DOING ANY MANUAL CALCULATIONS.  (You may find other\n\
ways to accomplish this goal.)\n\
\n\
\n\
INITIAL PREPARATION:\n\
\n\
(1) Read in the JD for your desired 3-D dataset.\n\
\n\
(2) Pop up the Grid Transform dialog box and preset the grid transform\n\
    values.  You must set the X and Y grid width and choose a right-handed\n\
    or left-handed coordinate system.  Since you do not know the X and Y\n\
    origins or the rotation angle, you can set these to zero (or to any other\n\
    values you want).  If you know an approximate rotation angle, type it\n\
    in.  Then press APPLY to update the grid transformation to the new\n\
    values.  Finally, to conserve space, make the Grid Transformation\n\
    dialog box smaller so that only the X and Y origin and the rotation\n\
    angle are visible.\n\
\n\
(3) Create CMP gathers (using the Data Control Panel) using this\n\
    (undoubtedly poor) grid transformation.  Then relax the data lock\n\
    (so you can change the grid transform later) by selecting "lock changes\n\
    to S/R gathers" instead of "lock changes to S/R/CMP gathers".\n\
\n\
SEE HOW GOOD YOUR ROTATION ANGLE IS:\n\
\n\
(4) Display a "bin centers distribution" plot:\n\
      Pop up QC Plots (under the Plots menu).\n\
      Select the "Bin Centers Distribution" attribute.\n\
      Press either the "Survey Coordinates" or the "Grid Coordinates"\n\
        radio button (your choice).\n\
      Press the "Update Coordinates" pushbutton.\n\
      Toggle "Extended Colors" on if necessary (maybe not necessary).\n\
      Press OK to get the plot.\n\
      Press "Options..." (or use mouse button 3) and choose "Picking\n\
        Options..." to get the Pick Menu popup.  Toggle off "Show Original\n\
        Transform" and "Show New Transform".\n\
\n\
(5) What the "bin centers distribution" plot means:\n\
    The various colors in the this plot represent the predominant\n\
    location of trace midpoints within their CMP bins, as identified by\n\
    the small 9-color diagram.  The color gray (labelled "5") means\n\
    that the trace midpoints fall predominantly in the middle of the\n\
    bin (desirable).  You will note that the colors in the "bin centers\n\
    distribution" plot are arranged in a somewhat irregular checkerboard\n\
    pattern.  The larger the square patches in this pattern are, the more\n\
    accurate the rotation angle currently is.  If the rotation angle\n\
    is very wrong, the square patches in this pattern will be very small,\n\
    with only a few CMP bins (or even only one bin) within each square.\n\
    If the rotation angle is nearly correct, the square patches will be\n\
    large.  If the rotation angle is dead right, the entire plot will be\n\
    the same color (with the possible exception of a few bins with\n\
    irregularities caused by lots of skids, etc.)\n\
\n\
OBTAIN AN APPROXIMATE ROTATION ANGLE:\n\
\n\
(6) If the square patches in the "bin centers distribution" plot are\n\
    a lot bigger than a single CMP bin, you already have an approximate\n\
    rotation angle and can skip to step (12).  But if the square patches\n\
    are very small, continue with step (7).\n\
\n\
(7) Select the "Change Angle" picking option on the Pick Menu popup.\n\
\n\
(8) Click and drag the pointer along a direction which you want to be\n\
    parallel to the X axis in the grid coordinate system.  This might be\n\
    along the edge of the survey, or along any "active line" which you\n\
    choose to have displayed on the plot.  For accuracy, drag along as much\n\
    of the full length of the plot as you can.  There are four orthogonal\n\
    directions you can choose from, depending on your desired orientation\n\
    of the grid system.  You can watch the rotation angle value in the\n\
    Grid Transform dialog box to help you choose the direction you want.\n\
    You can click and drag as many times as you wish until you are happy\n\
    with the result.\n\
\n\
(9) Save the new grid transform with the rotation angle you just picked.\n\
    Do this either by pressing "Save Transform" on the Pick Menu popup,\n\
    or by pressing "Apply" on the Grid Transformation popup.  Verify that\n\
    this save was successful by noting that the value of this new angle\n\
    has been copied to the right side of the Grid Transformation popup.\n\
    Then remove the "bin centers distribution" plot to get it out of the way.\n\
\n\
GET NEW CMP GATHERS AND NEW PLOT:\n\
\n\
(10) Create CMP gathers again, with this improved grid transform, by\n\
     repeating step (3).  It will be faster this time.\n\
\n\
(11) Display a new "bin centers distribution" plot by repeating step (4).\n\
\n\
CHOOSE A TEMPORARY ORIGIN:\n\
\n\
(12) Choose the "CMP Distribution Plot" picking option on the Pick Menu\n\
     popup.  This picking option works just like zooming up a small area,\n\
     except in this case you will get a new type of plot of the selected\n\
     area.\n\
\n\
(13) Select a SMALL area (3 or 4 CMP's square) anywhere within the "bin\n\
     centers distribution" plot, but preferably in a gray patch.  This\n\
     will give you a detailed plot of a few adjacent CMP bins whose midpoints\n\
     are approximately centered.  Make a MENTAL NOTE of which gray area you\n\
     are using.\n\
\n\
(14) Press "Options..." or use mouse button 3 and choose "Picking Options..."\n\
     to get the Pick Menu popup for this CMP distribution plot.  Then choose\n\
     "Define Origin" and click the pointer on any location which should\n\
     be a bin center.  This becomes a temporary origin which will be changed\n\
     later.\n\
\n\
REFINE THE ROTATION ANGLE:\n\
\n\
(15) Choose another "CMP Distribution Plot" by repeating steps (12) and (13).\n\
     But this time, select another similar small area within a color patch\n\
     ADJACENT to the gray patch used previously.\n\
\n\
(16) Repeat step (14), but this time choose "Refine Angle" and again click\n\
     the pointer on any location which should be a bin center.  This causes\n\
     a small rotation around the temporary origin previously picked, in\n\
     order to swing the coordinate system so that the point you just picked\n\
     ends up as close as possible to the center of its bin.\n\
\n\
(17) Save the new grid transform with the new (temporary) origin and\n\
     the new (refined) angle by repeating step (9).  Then remove the\n\
     "bin centers distribution" plot and both "CMP distribution" plots.\n\
\n\
CHECK YOUR RESULT:\n\
\n\
(18) Repeat steps (10) and (11).  Now the "bin centers distribution" plot\n\
     should have much larger squares, and ideally should be all gray, which\n\
     means that the trace midpoints over the survey are well-centered within\n\
     their respective bins.  To verify your results, you can choose one\n\
     or more new "CMP distribution" plots to look at.  If further\n\
     refinements are needed, you can repeat steps (12) through (18).\n\
\n\
CHOOSE THE FINAL ORIGIN:\n\
\n\
(19) Pop up the list of CMP gathers.  Set any X and Y bin center to any\n\
     integers you wish by typing anywhere in the rightmost two columns.\n\
     If you want the first X bin center to be 1, for example, you can type\n\
     a 1 into the first location in the X column, or into the "minimum"\n\
     field above the X column.  When you type into any field, the origin\n\
     is moved from the center of one bin to the center of another bin\n\
     without moving any bin boundaries.  This has the effect of re-defining\n\
     the origin WITHOUT putting your CMP gathers out-of-date.\n\
\n\
YOU ARE FINISHED!\n\

#HERE IS ONE SUGGESTED WAY TO DERIVE A GRID TRANSFORM FOR YOUR DATASET\n\
#GRAPHICALLY, WITHOUT DOING ANY MANUAL CALCULATIONS:\n\
#\n\
#\n\
#INITIAL PREPARATION:\n\
#\n\
#(1) Read in the JD for your desired 3-D dataset.\n\
#\n\
#(2) Pop up the Grid Transform dialog box and preset the grid transform\n\
#    values.  You must set XWIDTH and YWIDTH and choose a right-handed\n\
#    or left-handed coordinate system.  Since you do not know XORG, YORG,\n\
#    or ANGLE, you can set these to zero (or to any other values you want).\n\
#\n\
#(3) Create CMP gathers (using the Data Control Panel) using this\n\
#    (undoubtedly poor) grid transformation.\n\
#\n\
#OBTAIN AN APPROXIMATE ANGLE:\n\
#\n\
#(4) Display a "bin centers distribution" plot:\n\
#      Pop up QC Plots (under the Plots menu).\n\
#      Select bin centers distribution.\n\
#      Toggle extended colors on.\n\
#      Press OK to get the plot.\n\
#      Under "Options..." (or mouse button 3) choose "Picking Options...":\n\
#        Toggle off "show original transform" and "show new transform".\n\
#        Choose "change angle" picking option.\n\
#\n\
#      The various colors in the "bin centers distribution" plot represent\n\
#        the predominant location of trace midpoints within their bins, as\n\
#        identified by the small 9-color diagram.  You will note that the\n\
#        colors are arranged in a checkerboard pattern.  The orientation of\n\
#        this pattern corresponds to the desired orientation of the\n\
#        grid coordinate system (i.e. the desired rotation angle).  The\n\
#        larger the squares in this pattern are, the more accurate the\n\
#        rotation angle currently is.\n\
#\n\
#      Select the "Change Angle Option" and click and drag the pointer\n\
#        along a direction parallel to the colored squares in the\n\
#        "bin centers distribution" plot.\n\
#        For accuracy, drag along a color boundary over the full length\n\
#        of the plot.  The direction you drag will be parallel to the\n\
#        X axis in the grid coordinate system.  There are four orthogonal\n\
#        directions you can choose from, depending on your desired\n\
#        orientation of the grid system.  You can watch the ANGLE\n\
#        value in the Grid Transform dialog box to help you choose\n\
#        the direction you want.\n\
#\n\
#(5) Save the new grid transform with the angle you just picked.\n\
#\n\
#CHOOSE A TEMPORARY ORIGIN AND REFINE THE ANGLE:\n\
#\n\
#(6) Create CMP gathers again (it will be faster this time).\n\
#\n\
#(7) Pop up QC Plots (under the Plots menu) again, and replace the\n\
#    "bin centers distribution" plot by pressing "replace plot",\n\
#    "update coordinates", and "OK".\n\
#\n\
#(8) Choose "CMP distribution" plot and select a SMALL area (3 or 4 CMP's\n\
#    square) anywhere within the "bin centers distribution" plot.  This\n\
#    will give you a detailed plot of a few adjacent CMP bins.  Choose\n\
#    "define origin" and click the pointer on any location which should\n\
#    be a bin center.  This becomes a temporary origin which will be changed\n\
#    later.\n\
#\n\
#(9) Choose another "CMP distribution" plot and select another similar small\n\
#    area near the previous selection within the "bin centers distribution"\n\
#    plot.  The best area to select is within an adjacent colored region.\n\
#    This gives you a new detailed plot of a few adjacent CMP bins.  Choose\n\
#    "refine angle" and click the pointer on any location which should\n\
#    be a bin center.  This causes a small rotation around the temporary\n\
#    origin previously picked, in order to swing the coordinate system\n\
#    so that the point you just picked ends up as close as possible to\n\
#    the center of a bin.\n\
#\n\
#(10) Save the new grid transform with the new (temporary) origin and\n\
#     the new (refined) angle.\n\
#\n\
#CHECK YOUR RESULT:\n\
#\n\
#(11) Repeat (6) and (7).  Now the "bin centers distribution" plot should\n\
#     have much larger squares, and ideally should be all gray, which means\n\
#     that the trace midpoints over the survey are well-centered within\n\
#     their respective bins.  To verify your results, you can choose one\n\
#     or more new "CMP distribution" plots to look at.  If further\n\
#     refinements are needed, you can repeat (8), (9), and (10).\n\
#     Then repeat this step (11).\n\
#\n\
#CHOOSE THE FINAL ORIGIN:\n\
#\n\
#(12) Pop up the list of CMP gathers.  Set the first X and Y bin centers\n\
#     to 1 (or to any other integers you wish).  The origin is moved from\n\
#     the center of one bin to the center of another bin without moving any\n\
#     bin boundaries.  This has the effect of re-defining the origin\n\
#     without putting your CMP gathers out-of-date.\n\
#\n\
#YOU ARE FINISHED!\n\
