#
overview*PlotLabels:   Plot Annotation Pop-up...\n\
\n\
This Pop-up menu is the menu that allows you to set your\n\
Primary and Secondary timing line frequency, how often you\n\
want to label your data, the header words that you want to\n\
label your data by, and your Plot title.

#
#               The Processing Pop-up
#
overview*overview_process:   The Processing Pop-up...\n\
\n\
This option creates a pop-up window that contains the\n\
xcfe (X-Cray Front End) menu.  XCFE is a constrained\n\
version of CFE and allows you to construct a CPS (Conoco\n\
Processing System) job stream.  In the interactive mode,\n\
the processing steps setup by XCFE will be applied to\n\
input traces only, when the Interactive Processing and\n\
Process Data options are on and you OK the processing\n\
stream on the XCFE menu.  Once this has taken place, and\n\
when you select OK on the Input File Information menu,\n\
the data is processed as it is read in.  In this case\n\
the processing is actually being done on the platform\n\
that you are running CBYT from.\n\
\n\
In the batch mode, plans are to also enable the user in\n\
the future to actually build card images and create a\n\
.CINF file which can later be submitted as a batch job\n\
on the Cray.  The Batch Processing option is currently\n\
not accessible on the XCFE menu and is not operational\n\
at this time.\n\
\n\
There are currently only a limited number of single\n\
trace processes available under the constrained version\n\
of XCFE that run on platforms other than the Cray.\n\
\n\
They are XP, TPOW, MVXP, SHFT, and TSVF.  These will\n\
more than likely evolve to include other processes based\n\
on user needs and demands.\n\
\n\
An effort is being made to eventually ensure that the\n\
same processing code is loaded and runs on all platforms.\n\
This is not currently the case because the CPS Cray\n\
code is not ANSI standard.\n\

Segments.  
#
#          The Model Picking Menu
#
overview*overview_mod_pop:   The Model Picking Menu\n\
\n\
On the Model picking Menu, you can specify an Input Model\n\
File (if one is available), the Output Model File, the\n\
Output format, the Primary Header word, the Secondary Header\n\
Word, and the Tertiary Header Word for the file.\n\
\n\
On both the Menu and the Model Control panel you can\n\
specify the Horizon name, Color, Pick Type, and Snap option\n\
(if applicable), for each Horizon.  This menu also lets you\n\
define the interactive Pick Options and define, Select for\n\
edit, and delete Horizons and Horizon Segments.\n\
\n\
PICKING HORIZONS...\n\
\n\
In order to start picking on a Horizon or a Horizon Segment\n\
you must "Select" or make the Horizon or the Segment "Active".\n\
This is done by either clicking (depressing and releasing),\n\
mouse button #1 on the Horizon Name in the Horizon text box on\n\
the Menu or Control panel, or by holding down the Ctrl key\n\
while you point the mouse pointer at the Horizon or Segment\n\
that you want to make active, and clicking mouse button #1.\n\
\n\
For a New Horizon, simply depress this pushbutton and a\n\
New Horizon will be defined.  Of course you can change the\n\
name and color from the default values.  This New Horizon will\n\
be the "Active" Horizon unless you select another Horizon\n\
or define another New Horizon.\n\
\n\
If you are in the "Manual-No Snap" or "Manual-Snap" mode,\n\
to start picking on a horizon, you must be sure that the\n\
Pick Options on the main menu or the Control menu is set to\n\
either the "Add to beg.", "Add to end", or the "Insert Pick"\n\
mode.  The default setting for the Pick Options is "Add to\n\
end".\n\
\n\
To begin picking a Horizon, place the mouse pointer at the\n\
point that you want to start picking the Horizon and click\n\
mouse button #1.  This will draw a single point where your\n\
mouse pointer is pointing.\n\
\n\
Now you can either move your mouse pointer to the next point\n\
that you want to pick and click mouse button #1, or keeping\n\
the mouse pointer on the first point, you can depress and\n\
hold down mouse button #1 and drag it to the next point.\n\
\n\
If you simply clicked mouse button #1, the pick will\n\
be inserted at the pointer location and a line will be\n\
drawn from the previous pick to the new pick.  If you\n\
depressed and held down mouse button #1, A rubberband\n\
line will be drawn from the previous pick to the new\n\
pick.  This rubberband line will move as you move the\n\
pointer.  To make a pick, simply release the mouse button.\n\
The pick will be at the pointer location that you were\n\
at when you released the button and a solid line will be\n\
drawn from the previous pick to the newest pick.\n\
\n\
If you desire to move any single pick, you may do this by\n\
placing your mouse pointer on the point and then depressing\n\
and holding down both the Shift key on the keyboard and mouse\n\
button #1.  While holding these down, drag the mouse pointer\n\
to your new desired location for the point and release both\n\
the key and button.  You pick will now be at the new location.\n\
\n\
You may delete any point at any time on the active Horizon\n\
by placing the mouse pointer on the point that you wish to\n\
delete and clicking mouse button #2.  To delete several picks\n\
at once, you can delete the entire Horizon, delete a Segment\n\
of the Horizon, or use the Area Delete option.  This option\n\
works by holding down Ctrl Mouse Button #2 at the same time\n\
and dragging the mouse pointer diagonally to define an area\n\
within which to delete all picks on the active Horizon.\n\
\n\
To Delete a Horizon or Delete a Segment you must first make\n\
sure that the Horizon or Segment that you want deleted is the\n\
"Active" Horizon.  Then to delete it you simply depress\n\
the appropriate button on the Control Panel.\n\
\n\
If you are in the Auto Pick mode, to make your first pick\n\
you simply place your mouse pointer at a point that you\n\
wish to pick, and depress and release mouse button #1.\n\
Your pick will "Snap" to one of the following: the nearest\n\
peak, nearest trough, positive zero-crossing, or negative\n\
zero-crossing.  This will be dependant upon what you have\n\
selected on the "Snap" options menu.  After you have made\n\
your first pick, you simply point and click on the next\n\
location.  A solid line will appear with snapped picks\n\
on every trace between your endpoints.  The delete options\n\
described above work the same as described above when you\n\
are in this mode.\n\
\n\
With the Auto Pick Mode, once you start picking in one\n\
direction, you may only pick in that direction.  You cannot\n\
pick a series of picks with this option in one direction\n\
and then go to the first pick and try to pick points going\n\
in the other direction.

#
overview*overview_globals:  The View History Option \n\
\n\
This option allows you to view the history file of any .glbl file\n\
in any directory without leaving CBYT or opening a new and seperate\n\
window.\n\
\n\
The default file in the View History window is the .glbl file which\n\
corresponds to the bite file being viewed.  You can however key in\n\
or select any file based on the filter that you set.  
help*globalpop*Help:  The View History option...Alt-G\n\
\n\
This option lets you View the CPS job history file of\n\
any byte file that you have on the workstation.  The option\n\
reads the history file from the .glbl file.  Therefore\n\
in order to take advantage of this option, you should\n\
save and output your history files when you create your\n\
byte files on the Cray.

pop-up menu.  With this menu you can specify all of your\n\
Data Selection Parameters, your Data Display Parameters,\n\
whether or not you want to run a movie, and whether or not\n\
you want to maximize the plotting area of the entire\n\
screen.  You can also invoke the Annotation pop-up menu\n\
and Processing pop-up menu from this menu.\n\
\n\ 
When you specify your input data, a CPS Byte file format\n\
is assumed, however the program can read the CPS STRIN\n\
and DTRIN formats, as well as an IEEE format.  The IEEE\n\
format is the output from the CPS NDSKO program.  Files\n\
with this floating point format or BYTE files can easily\n\
be downloaded from the CRAY, across the network to any\n\
platform.\n\
\n\
If your data is not in CPS BYTE file format but is in one\n\
of the formats specified above, CBYT is smart enough to\n\
decode the file and read it in without you specifying\n\
any other information other than the filename.

pushbutton is highlighted (focused), you can\n\
hit the Tab key.  If you hit the Tab key, the\n\
focus will move to the box to the right where\n\
you can key in the pathname and filename.  If\n\
this information is not known, and you want to\n\
move back to the Filename... button, either\n\
move the mouse pointer to the box to the left\n\
where the word Filename... is written and click\n\
mouse button #1, or use the Shift Tab key\n\
combination to move to this box.\n\
\n\
The file selection pop-up menu allows you to\n\
easily search through your directories and files\n\
to find and select the file that you are wanting\n\
to display.  The filter option on this pop-up is\n\
a powerful tool that allows you to use wild card\n\
annotation to help you search.  Items are selected\n\
from this menu by simply pointing the mouse\n\
pointer at the appropriate item and clicking mouse\n\
button #1.\n\
\n\
The filter option is used by typing in the desired\n\
information to search on in the Filter field and\n\
then double clicking mouse button #1 on the Filter\n\
pushbutton.  Once a file has been selected, simply\n\
point and click on the word OK, and the pathname\n\
and filename will automatically be written into\n\
the field to the right of the Filename... parameter\n\
on the Byte File Information pop-up menu, as if you\n\
had keyed it in yourself.\n\
\n\
There are several file formats that CBYT\n\
currently accepts and automatically decodes.  A\n\
CPS Byte file format is available on all platforms.\n\
The CPS floating point STRIN and DTRIN formats are\n\
available on the Cray and the IEEE format (known\n\
as a TFILE format from the CPS NDSKO process), is\n\
also a floating point format and can be downloaded\n\
to any platform on the network.\n\
\n\
Once a Filename has been selected or entered, tab\n\
or point and click on the nplt parameter on the\n\
Input File Information pop-up menu.  This will\n\
automatically set some defaults based on information\n\
contained in the file that you are reading in.\n\
Total nplt, tmin, and tmax of the file that was\n\
read will also be listed at the bottom of the Data\n\
Selection Parameters section of the Input File\n\
Information Menu.

where the word Filename... is written and click button #1 or\n\
use the Shift Tab key combination to move to this box, and then\n\
click mouse button #1.  This will bring up a file selection\n\
pop-up menu from which you can choose your file.
#
#  nplt... 
#
help*ntot:  The nplt parameter...\n\
\n\
This is the parameter that allows you to specify\n\
how many traces you want to read in and plot to\n\
the screen.  The I/O routines in CBYT are linked to\n\
the display routines so that whatever is read in\n\
from a file is also put into a pixmap for plotting\n\
to the screen. The default value for this parameter\n\
is 100 traces but you can set this to whatever you\n\
desire.\n\
\n\
To gain focus on this field, point and click, or\n\
tab to this field.  Once it is focused, the field\n\
will be outlined in red and an informational line\n\
will be displayed at the bottom of the Data Selection\n\
section of the Input File Information pop-up menu.\n\
This information line contains the Total number of\n\
traces in the file - (nplt), the minimum input\n\
time - (tmin), and the maximum output time - (tmax).\n\
This information is read directly from the file and\n\
is used to set some defaults for you.  It's also\n\
listed for you on this menu so that you will always\n\
know what these data limits are.\n\
\n\
Some hardware devices have a very limited amount\n\
of graphics memory available.  In some cases, only\n\
slightly more than a screenful of pixel memory is\n\
available.  Others have 8 megabytes or more available.\n\
If you set this value too large based on the graphics\n\
memory available on your device or based on what the\n\
graphics drivers of your device can handle, you might\n\
have problems plotting a large number of traces.  In\n\
some cases and on some devices, CBYT will give you\n\
a warning and ask you if you want to truncate your data\n\
to be able to display it at the ct and plot scales\n\
that you have specified.  In other cases if this number\n\
is too large, your plot may just turn out to be\n\
undesirable or unusable.  As long as you have\n\
sufficient graphics memory and your graphics drivers\n\
can handle the number of traces you desire to read\n\
in and plot, you should be able to plot and pan through\n\
just about as much data as you want to read in.

The ct parameter is defined as the number of channels\n\
per trace.  When you plot your data NORM=YES, this \n\
parameter controls the maximum deviation of the\n\
largest amplitude on the trace.  When you plot your data\n\
NORM=NO, this parameter controls the maximum deviation\n\

    In SPLT for NORM=NO, this parameter controls the\n\
    maximum deviation of the largest deviation in the\n\

\n\
A ct=4 means that the largest amplitude can only deviate\n\
four traces.  The deviation for all other amplitudes on\n\
the trace is relative to the largest amplitude on the\n\
trace.  This parameter does not apply to variable density\n\

\n\
If you are plotting your data as Variable Density\n\
rather than Variable Area or Wigl only, you will be\n\
using 8 times more memory for the same image.  This\n\
is because Variable Area and Wigl only use a single\n\

run XCFE.  XCFE is a constrained version of CFE and\n\
allows you to construct a CPS (Conoco Processing System)\n\
job stream.  In the interactive mode, the processing steps\n\
setup by XCFE will be applied to input traces only, when\n\
the Interactive Processing and Process Data options\n\
are on and you OK the processing stream on the XCFE menu.

#   Maximize pushbutton... 
#
help*max:  The Maximize pushbutton...\n\
\n\
By pointing and clicking on this pushbutton with\n\
mouse button #1, you will be given the option to\n\
automatically recalculate the traces per cm or\n\
inch, and cm or inches per second based on the nplt\n\
and ct values specified.  The calculated values\n\
will be such that the entire screen area will be\n\
being used to plot the data, (e.g the plotting area\n\
will be maximized).
#
#   Movie pushbutton...
#
help*movie:  The Movie pushbutton...\n\
\n\
When this pushbutton is depressed, the user is\n\
telling the program that he wishes to flicker\n\
through his dataset in a movie fashion.  To use\n\
this option, each comparison dataset must have\n\
the same number of traces and be contained in\n\
the same file, (i.e one file with n versions of\n\
the same or a similar dataset).  If you are starting\n\
out with separate byte files for each dataset, you\n\
will need to run the stand alone program known as\n\
BYTE_MERGE, to merge the byte files into one file.\n\
\n\
In CBYT, you will next need to specify nplt which\n\
should be the number of traces per dataset.  You\n\
should have the same number of traces in each\n\
dataset.  When the Movie pushbutton is depressed,\n\
the Number Frames parameter will become active and\n\
and will be set to a default of 10.  You can reset\n\
this parameter to the number of datasets you have\n\
in the byte file that you wish to compare.  Your\n\
only limit is how much graphics memory you have\n\
available in your X-device, versus how much data\n\
you are trying to read in.\n\
\n\
Once the data has been loaded, you will notice\n\
that the Scan Right and Scan Left buttons at the\n\
the bottom of the display windows have been replaced\n\
by Movie Control arrows.  If you place mouse button\n\
#1 on one of the arrows and click on it, you will\n\
see the data flicker to the next frame of the movie.\n\
The slider bar will also move toward the arrow, and\n\
the number above the slider bar will change.  If\n\
you want, you can focus on the slider bar by simply\n\
pointing to it and clicking on it using the mouse.\n\
Now point at the slider bar again, however this time\n\
hold the button down and move the mouse to the left\n\
or right.  The display will quickly flicker through\n\
the appropriate number of frames based on your\n\
movement.  When you are focused on the slider bar,\n\
you can run a continuous movie in either direction\n\
by simply holding down either the left or right\n\
arrow-key on your keyboard.\n\
\n\
In the Tie Line mode, the Movie option allows you\n\
to see two different data files which correlate,\n\
in a movie at the same time.  These could be Constant\n\
Velocity Stacks and their corresponding CDP (Common\n\
Depth Point) Gathers, or even Depth Migrations and\n\
their corresponding CIP (Common Image Point), gathers.\n\
You control what is displayed on each side of the Tie\n\
Line display with your output Byte file and input\n\
parameters.\n\
\n\
To run a DUAL movie in the Tie Line mode, read in\n\
your primary data set first.  Be sure to setup your\n\
the way you want it for both data sets.  The Primary\n\
file movie controls are the only movie controls.  You\n\
are therefore currently forced to set the same number\n\
of panels for both the Primary and Tie files.\n\
\n\
After you have read in your Primary file, read in your\n\
tie file the same way you would in the normal Tie Line\n\
mode.  Be sure to only specify nplt equal to the number\n\
of traces in one panel.\n\
\n\
Once the Tie Line data has been read in, you can\n\
run the DUAL movie the same way you run any other\n\
movie.\n\
\n\
To run a SINGLE movie with a FIXED Tie Line Display,\n\
read in your primary dataset with the movie option\n\
turned off.  Next read in your Tie Line dataset the way\n\
you normally would.  Now, access the Input File\n\
Information menu again using the Setup/Change plot\n\
option.  This time set the movie option and specify the\n\
number of frames.  Once you've done this, read in your\n\
primary dataset again.  After the Primary dataset\n\
has been read in again, you will be able to movie\n\
through the Primary dataset while the Tie Line dataset\n\
remains fixed.
#
#   Number frames...
#
help*mframes: Number of Frames...\n\
\n\
The Number Frames parameter is only active when the Movie\n\
pushbutton is depressed.  This parameter is set to a default\n\
of 10.  You can reset this parameter to the number of datasets\n\
you have in your file that you wish to compare.\n\
\n\
The number of traces in each dataset "Frame", should\n\
be the same.  This is specified by the nplt parameter when\n\
in the Movie mode. 
#
#         Tie Line PushButton...
#
help*tieline:   Tie Line...Alt-T\n\
\n\
This option brings up a pop-up menu similar to the Input\n\
File Information menu and lets you read in another file or\n\
the same file twice, for display within the same window.\n\
This option will let you visually correlate across a fault\n\
on the same line, or lets you compare two tie lines at\n\
their intersection.\n\
\n\
When you select this option and the pop-up menu appears,\n\
you will notice that the name at the top of this menu is\n\
Tie Line Information.  You will see no change under\n\
the Data Selection Parameters section of the menu when\n\
compared to the Input File Information menu.  You will\n\
however notice that under the Data Display Parameters\n\
section of this menu, the Inches/sec or cm/sec parameter,\n\
as well as as the Maximize and Movie pushbuttons are\n\
missing.  These three parameters are controlled on the\n\
Input File Information menu for both datasets.  The\n\
other parameters on this menu can all be set seperately\n\
from the parameters on the Input File Information menu.\n\
\n\
In the display window, your Primary dataset will be\n\
displayed on the left side of the data window and your Tie\n\
dataset will be displayed on the right side of the data\n\
window.  Each side of the window can be independently\n\
scrolled in either the vertical or horizontal direction. \n\
The time differential between the data in the windows is\n\
listed in a readout box at the bottom of the display\n\
window.\n\
\n\
The Zoom by Pointer option as well as the Movie option\n\
will also work while in the Tie Line Mode.\n\
\n\
In this mode, the Zoom option works differently than it\n\
does in the normal display mode of the program.  When\n\
you zoom, in the Tie Line mode, the intersection of the\n\
images control the zoom.  The area zoomed will always\n\
be tied to the intersection.  You define the image on one\n\
side of the intersection and a mirror image from the\n\
display on the other side of the intersection is also\n\
automatically zoomed with the intersection as the common\n\
boundary between the zoomed images.\n\
\n\
The Movie option allows you to see two different data\n\
files in a movie at the same time, or the primary dataset\n\
in a movie with the Tie Line data set stationary.  These\n\
could be Constant Velocity Stacks and the corresponding\n\
CDP Gathers, or even Depth Migrations and their\n\
corresponding CIP gathers.  You control what is displayed\n\
on each side of the Tie Line display with your output\n\
Byte file and input parameters.

#        The quit... parameter
#
help*quit: Quitting CBYT - quit...Alt-Q\n\
\n\
This option gives you a graceful way of quitting\n\
the CBYT program.  To quit the CBYT program using\n\
this option you need only move your mouse pointer\n\
to the File Pushbutton on the menu bar.  While holding\n\
mouse button #1 down, pulldown to the quit... option\n\
and release.  If you have never read in any data, the\n\
program will automatically quit.  If you have read in \n\
data, a dialogue box will appear and prompt you as to\n\
whether you are sure you want to quit.  If you point\n\
and click the mouse pointer on YES, you will exit the\n\
program.  If you point and click the mouse pointer on\n\
NO, you will return to the point in the program where\n\
you were before you selected the quit option.

help*.cbar:  The Pop-up Color Bar...Alt-B\n\
\n\
This option can only be accessed when you have specified\n\
Variable Density on the Input File Information pop-up\n\
menu.  When Color Bar is selected, a window is opened\n\
and displayed which contains the defined color bar for the\n\
Variable Density plot that has been plotted on your\n\
graphics display screen.  The Variable density parameters.\n\
used to control the colors and amplitude distribution used\n\
in your display are defined under the Variable Density\n\
Options... pop-up menu.  This menu can be found under the\n\
Customize pulldown menu.\n\
\n\
You will notice in the window containing the Color Bar,\n\
two slider bar controls.  One of these is labled Intensity\n\
and the other is labeled Compression.\n\
\n\
The Intensity slider bar is identical to the intensity\n\
control on a CRT.  With this control, you can make the\n\
display window lighter or darker.\n\
\n\
The Compression slider bar allows you to interactively\n\
stretch or compress the color bar thus interactively\n\
changing the number of colors and how the data appears.\n\
The scale used in the algorithm for this option is\n\
logarithmic and so the stretching and compression is done\n\
in a non-linear fashion.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
\n\
  You must already have your data displayed as Variable\n\
  Density data before you can access or display this Color\n\
  bar.

help*mute:  Mute...Alt-M\n\
\n\
Prior to selecting the Mute option, you should set up\n\
your CBYT display to where you are comfortable with the\n\
display.  The first Shot File or CDP gather in the BYTE file\n\
should be displayed on the graphics screen.  If you are picking\n\
a near trace section, be sure to read in and display to pixel\n\
memory all of the near traces.  If these traces go off the\n\
screen you will be able to PAN to the portion not visible and\n\
finish picking the data.\n\
\n\
The Mute option allows you the user to interactively\n\
pick a mute and store it in a file.  This Mute file can\n\
be accessed by the CPS mute process on the Cray.  Mutes can\n\
be picked from shot gathers, or CDP gathers.  Near trace mutes\n\
can also be picked with this option.\n\
\n\
To select this option, simply depress mouse button #1 while\n\
the mouse pointer is over the word Pick on the menu bar.  Then\n\
pull the mouse down while still holding mouse button #1 down.\n\
Release the mouse button when the pointer is on the Mute\n\
pushbutton.  This pushbutton will cause a Mute Pick Options\n\
pop-up menu to appear.\n\
\n\
On the Mute menu, you can specify an Input Mute File (if\n\
one is available), the Output Mute File, the Number of Picks\n\
or how many offsets to pick, the Primary Header word for\n\
the file, the Secondary Header Word for the file, and the\n\
Minimum Offset and the Maximum Offset in the file.  On this\n\
menu you can alos depress the User Defined locations\n\
togglebutton instead of specifying the Number of picks, and\n\
you will be able to interactively define the locations of your\n\
picks on your first gather.\n\
\n\
Once you have specified all of the necessary parameters on\n\
the Mute Pick options menu, point and click mouse button\n\
#1 on the OK button.  The menu will be removed and you can\n\
now pick and save your mutes.\n\
\n\
The output file that you create can be accessed and the\n\
mute applied by the CPS Mute process on the Cray.\n\
\n\
To pick a mute, place the mouse pointer at the point\n\
that you want the mute to begin and depress mouse button\n\
#1.  While holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse\n\
pointer to the next point that you want to define in the\n\
mute and release the mouse button.  Notice that a rubberband\n\
line will be drawn from your first point to the mouse pointer\n\
as you are moving the pointer.  This line should help you\n\
visualize the approximate location of your mute as your are\n\
picking it.\n\
\n\
When you release the mouse button, your end points will\n\
jump to the nearest offsets that you have defined.  This\n\
is based on the number of points parameter that you specify\n\
on the Mute Pick Options menu.  A solid line with X's marking\n\
your defined offsets will then be drawn from one end point to\n\
the other end point.  When the you define a mute close to zero\n\
time, and the mute projects past zero time, the mute values\n\
affected by this projection will be set to zero.\n\
\n\
Repeat this process for the next line segment that you are\n\
using to define the mute and so on until you have defined\n\
your entire mute for the CDP gather or Shot File.  You can\n\
redefine any or all of the mute at any time.\n\
\n\
You might note that Mouse button #2 can be used to give you\n\
NULL picks.  When a pick is NULLED, this means that the CPS MUTE\n\
process on the Cray will recognize this value as a NULL rather\n\
than a zero and do the appropriate interpolation and extrapolation\n\
based on other picked times.  A NULL is represented on your display\n\
by the letter N rather than an X.\n\
\n\
To accept your picks, place the mouse pointer on the Scan Right\n\
arrow at the bottom left of the display and depress and release\n\
mouse button #1.  Your picks are automatically saved.  (Note: If\n\
you are reading your data in a Left to Right plot direction,\n\
point and click on the Scan Left arrow.)\n\
\n\
The next gather in the file will then automatically be displayed\n\
with the picks from the previous gather overlain on top of the\n\
gather.  You can either accept these picks or repick any point\n\
or group of points on this gather.  To accept these picks simply\n\
point and click on the Scan Right arrow again.  If you repick\n\
any or all of the mute, point and click on the Scan Right arrow\n\
once you are happy with your picks for that gather and again\n\
your picks will automatically be saved and the next gather will\n\
appear with the latest picks overlain on top of the gather.\n\
\n\
If you a reading in a previous mute file (.mute file), and want\n\
to look at the previous picks, or backing up to an area that you\n\
have already picked on a current mute file, the program is smart\n\
enough to overlay the previous picks for that gather rather than\n\
the latest picks that you have made on the previous gather.\n\
\n\
When you have finished picking your mutes for the line, you can\n\
point to the End Picking pushbutton at the bottom of the display\n\
window, or go up to the pulldown menu under the Pick option\n\
and pull down to the End picking option and release the mouse\n\
button. 
\n\
You can view your mute parameters at anytime, by simply selecting\n\
the Mute option from the Pick pulldown menu.  If you are picking\n\
If you are picking mutes or have a Mute Input File specified\n\
other than the word NONE, all parameters other than the Mute\n\
Output File are inaccessible when you are viewing this menu so\n\
that you don't change the values that have already been set in\n\
your existing output file.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
\n\
    If you exit the mute option at anytime and you haven't\n\
    finished picking, you can always re-enter this option\n\
    and input the name of the file that you had previously\n\
    specified as your output file.  This file contains all of\n\
    the picks that you made in the previous session.\n\
\n\
    If you read in this input file and display a gather that\n\
    you have already picked, the picks that you saved in the\n\
    file will be overlain on the gather.  Also, anytime you\n\
    back up and look at a gather that you had previously picked\n\
    and saved the picks on, the picks that are stored in the file\n\
    will be overlain on the corresponding gather.\n\
\n\
CAUTION:\n\
\n\
    The Vax SHIFT file format used to store mutes uses comment\n\
    cards in the file to store additional information which\n\
    allows for unequal spacing in the offset and or CDP directions.\n\
    Therefore, this file cannot be extended, truncated, or resampled\n\
    in ISEP (although pick times can be edited in ISEP).

help*userpoint:   The User Defined Locations togglebutton...\n\

When this option is selected, you are telling the program that\n\
you will define the offset locations that you want to use for the\n\
mute when you pick your first gather.  The Number of picks, Min.\n\
Offset, and Max. Offset parameters are made insensitive when\n\
this option is selected since you will be defining the pick\n\
locations interactively.  Keep in mind that the same offsets\n\
that you define on the first gather will have to be used for\n\
every gather on the line.  If you have asymmetrical split spread\n\
Shot Files that you are picking from, a rapidly changing water-\n\
bottom or surface elevation, or a rapidly changing near surface\n\
velocity layer, then this option will probably not work very well.

This is the output file name that you will save your mute\n\

can be viewed and edited using the ISEP program.  To save\n\
your mute picks, you can accept the default name or specify\n\
any name that you wish.  It is recommended that you use a\n\
.mute extension so that this file can be easily identified\n\
for future access.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
\n\
If a .mute file exists with the same prefix as the output\n\
file that you specify, the Mute Input File name is automatically\n\
defaulted to this file when the output file is specified.\n\
\n\
Likewise, if a .mute file exists with the same name that you\n\
specified as the Input file, the Output file will automatically\n\
be set to this name.\n\

#
#   Number of Picks...
#
help*mpck:  Number of Picks - \n\
\n\
This parameter lets you identify the number of offsets that\n\
you want to use to define a mute.  Since CPS requires you to\n\
use the same offsets down a line for all gathers when picking\n\
a mute, your mute picks will be set to the nearest offset that\n\
is defined by this parameter.  This is indicated by an X on the\n\
plot of your data.  To use this option, the User Defined Offsets\n\
pushbutton must be in the off or up position.\n\
\n\
If you specify the same Number of Picks as you have traces per\n\
gather, you will have a pick for every trace.  If you specify \n\
half the Number of Picks as you have traces per gather, you will\n\
have a pick on every other trace, and so on.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
\n\
For split spread data where you are shooting through the cable\n\
or where the near survace velocity or surface elevation changes\n\
rapidly, you will want to specify a Number of Picks so that it\n\
is close to the number of traces per gather.\n\
                              also\n\
When picking mutes on split spread Shot File data, CBYT will\n\
automatically differentiate between positive and negative offsets\n\
so that the mute can be different on each side of the Shot file.\n\
The CPS Mute process on the Cray will automatically apply these\n\
these mutes correctly when the mute file contains negative offsets\n\
Offsets are interpreted by CBYT and Mute to be negative when the\n\
receiver ground position (header word 47) is smaller than the\n\
sourse ground position (header word 46).
#
#   Primary header word...
#
help*hwd:  Primary header...\n\
\n\
Picked Mute times will be applied by the CPS Mute process \n\
based on the header word specified by this parameter.  This\n\
parameter specifies how the mute will be applied down the\n\
line.  You will need to enter the header word that you desire to\n\
use.  The program will automatically set this header word to 17\n\
("BSMT" distance coordinate), if your data is CDP order, and 46\n\
(sequential source ground position), if your data is Shot File\n\
order.  You may reset this value if you desire by specifying\n\
a different header word.  When you apply your mute in the CPS\n\
process, you will also be allowed to specify a different header\n\
word to use to apply the mute or use the value specified here\n\
which is stored in the .mute file.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
\n\
For the Primary header word, the default used for Shot Files is\n\
header word 46 rather than header word 9.  This is so that the\n\
mutes will be interpolated more intelegently on the Cray because\n\
of the possibility of irregular placements of Shots in the field.\n\
                              also\n\
When picking mutes on split spread Shot File data, CBYT will\n\

#
help*hwd2:  Secondary header...\n\
\n\
This header word is the header that you wish to use to store\n\
the times that you are picking.  For CDP gathers and Shot Files\n\
you will normally have this set to header word #6. (the default\n\
value).  However, if you are picking mutes on near trace gathers,\n\
you will want to set the Primary header word to on appropriate\n\
value and set this header word to header word 7, 17, 37, or some\n\
other appropriate header word.

\n\
When this button is depressed, besides having access to the\n\
Grade Vertical, Grade Horizontal and Overlay Increment options,\n\
you now can access the Color Selection Parameters and Trace\n\
Amplitude Parameters.  This means that you can either use\n\
a pre-defined Color Bar which is hardwired into the program,\n\
or read in an RGB Color Bar from your directory.  You can also\n\
specify the Trace Amplitudes by Percentage, Minimum and Maximum\n\
amplitude to use, or predefined values that are specified within\n\
the Color Bar.\n\
\n\
When this option is selected, you will need to recalculate your\n\
amplitude distribution and display the data that you previously\n\
specified on the Input File Information menu, using the Color Bar\n\
and Trace Amplitude Parameters that you specified on this menu.\n\
To do this you must depress the OK or Apply pushbuttons.\n\
\n\
As long as your data was specified as Variable Density on the\n\
Input File Information menu, the data will be displayed according\n\

0 (Zero), you will overlay a wiggle trace, based on the\n\
frequency that you specify with this parameter, at its\n\
corresponding location on the Variable Density display.\n\
\n\
For example:\n\
\n\
An increment of 1 will overlay every trace; an increment\n\
of 2 will overlay every other trace; an increment of 3\n\
3 will overlay every third trace and etc.\n\
\n\

   4. Show Version...Alt-V  This option allows you to activate\n\
      an information pop-up which shows the version of CBYT that\n\
      you are running.\n\
\n\
This program allows you to read in and display either\n\
floating point or byte data.  You can utilize an initial\n\
skip and/or a do skip pattern to input your data\n\
if you so desire.  You can plot your data as wiggle\n\
trace, wiggle trace with variable area, or as\n\
variable density displays.  Plot direction, polarity,\n\
annotation, CT and plot scale are all parameters\n\
that you control.\n\
\n\
CBYT is a MOTIF and X-Windows based program.  It\n\
was written so that it would be portable and would\n\
run on a variety of platforms.  It currently runs\n\
under Ultrix on the Decstation, Unix on the Sun,\n\
Unicos on the Cray, and VMS on the VAX.\n\
\n\
You can navigate through the program with the use\n\
the Tab key, mouse, or with the use of the accelerator\n\
keys.  You can also scan through your data by a fixed\n\
number of traces in either the forward or reverse\n\
direction and zoom up on your data by a factor of ten,\n\
using either one of two zoom options.  You can display\n\
two datasets side by side, setup a Movie Loop (a single\n\
display, a dual movie, or a single movie with a fixed\n\
tie display), or open Multiple display windows from\n\
within the program.\n\
\n\
CBYT allows a processor to pick mutes and stores\n\
these mutes in a file that can be read by the CPS\n\
Mute process on the Cray.  Cbyt also allows you to do\n\
some single trace processing on data as it is read in.\n\
Variable density can also easily be displayed in color\n\
using Cbyt by specifying a predefined color bar.\n\
\n\
If you desire help on any field, you need only select\n\
the Context Sensitive Help from the Help button on the\n\
menu bar.  You can also depress F1, PF1, Alt-H, or the\n\
Help key on the keyboard for Help on the field that is\n\
currently focused.\n\
\n\
The program also has a Quick options pop-up menu\n\
available by depressing mouse button #3.  This menu\n\
gives you quick and easy access to the information\n\
and options most often used.
#
#   Insert/Remove mouse button help line... 
#
help*setmhelp: The Insert/Remove mouse button help line option...\n\
\n\
The mouse help line is the information line displayed\n\
at the bottom of the CBYT window.  Its only purpose\n\
is to tell you which mouse buttons are active and what\n\
they do.  This option controls whether or not this help\n\
line is displayed.  The default is to display it.
#
#   Show Version...Alt-V 
#
help*ver_help:  Show Version...Alt-V\n\
\n\
Since CBYT is new and still evolving the purpose of\n\
this option is simply to show you which version of\n\
CBYT that you are running.

#  Trace Selector
#
overview*overview_Selector: \n\
\n\
  Select traces by up to three header ranges.\n\
The trace pattern you have selected on the main menu\n\
is honored while the selector is doing it's search.\n\
This should allow greater flexibility in navigating\n\
the file for desired traces. If for instance you have\n\
specified nplt 100 skip 50, the selector will skip the\n\
first 50 traces and search the file for the header\n\
values you have specified until it finds 100 traces\n\
that meet your header search parameters.\n\
  When the search is completed the information label\n\
will tell you the results of the search.\n\
  If you had specified 3 movie frames with this example\n\
the selector will try to find 3 frames of 100 traces that\n\
meet your header search parameters. Again, when the search\n\
is completed the information label will tell you the results\n\
of the search. In this movie case you may not get all of\n\
the frames desired and the information label will tell you\n\
how many frames it could find. Note that it is possible that\n\
the last frame may have less than the requested number of traces\n\
but this frame should plot ok with fewer traces.\n\
\n\
  A basic example of use:\n\
     Primary Header 1, min 1, max 10, increment 3\n\
  Will give you traces\n\
     1, 4, 7, and 10\n\
\n\
  If you had not specified an increment (i.e. 0)\n\
  you would get the min thru max values (traces 1 thru 10).

you select is subtracted from the first.\n\
\n\
  No interpolated resampling is currently done so your data must\n\
have the same sample rate. Currently no sub-selection of data is\n\
supported so you should have comparable traces already displayed\n\
of the files you are going to compare. The algorithm will try to\n\
find common traces and times of each file.

  A test option that maps the actual trace float values to the color map\n\
instead of converting them to bytes and then mapping. This may provide\n\
better resolution for the image and hardcopies, particularly on data with\n\
a large dynamic range. Note that this method will be about three times \n\
slower to display.

  This is a test option that centers the trace's zero amplitudes to the\n\
color at the middle of the color bar. Also trace values greater and less\n\
than the percentages requested are placed at the center of the color\n\
bar. Note that the color bar pop up may not be representative.
