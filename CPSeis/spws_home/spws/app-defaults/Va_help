#                  AND DIALOGUE BOXES.
#
#   Overview help for the Input/Display menu... 
#
overview*overview_vainput_pop:  Overview help for the Input/Display menu...\n\
\n\
                       DATA SELECTION\n\
\n\
This is the initial menu that you must visit when running the VA\n\
program if you desire to input Semblance Data, CMP data, or GVS/CVST\n\
data.  This menu also lets you input an initial velocity file however,\n\
velocity files can also be read in through the Read (Second) Velocity\n\
File option.  This option is located under the File pulldown on the\n\
menu bar.\n\
\n\
The pushbuttons located to the left of each File type togglebutton\n\
should be depressed for the type of data that you wish to read in.\n\
If the button is not depressed for a type of data, the data file will\n\
not be read in.\n\
\n\
When you read in your various data files, valid default parameters\n\
are obtained from these files for each type of Display that you desire.\n\
\n\
                       OPTIONS - (DISPLAY MENUS)\n\
\n\
The bottom half of this menu gives you the opportunity to acess the\n\
Display menus for the various types of data that you are reading in\n\
and will be displaying.\n\
\n\
To acess a certian Display menu simply place the mouse pointer on\n\
the appropriate togglebutton and depress and release mouse button #1.\n\
\n\
Once the appropriate menu has been displayed, you can either review\n\
or modify any of the variables on the menu.  The pre-set default\n\
values are only an educated guess on what you might want the values\n\
to be.\n\
\n\
Once you have read in and displayed your data, If you wish to change\n\
any parameters, you can acess these same menus from the Display\n\
pulldown on the menu bar.\n\
\n\
REMEMBER - To view a dataset that you have read in, you will need to\n\
ensure that the window for that dataset is turned on.  To turn on\n\
or off a window, place the mouse pointer on the Windows pulldown.\n\
You will find the Windows pulldown on the menu bar.  With your mouse\n\
on this pulldown, depress mouse button #1.  The four possible types\n\
of windows will be displayed.  Next to these window types are\n\
pushbuttons.  For any one of these windows to be displayed in the\n\
main VA display area, you will need to make sure that the appropriate\n\
pushbutton is depressed.\n\
\n\
Simply point and click mouse button #1 on the appropriate pushbutton\n\
to turn on or off the window.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
\n\
It is worth the time to review the parameter settings for each type\n\
of display that you will be creating.  This is important because\n\
some GVS/CVST datasets are large and take a considerable amount of\n\
time to read in.  When you point and click on OK or Apply on this \n\
menu, you will be reading in all of the data files that you have\n\
specified.
#
#   Overview help for the GVS/CVST menu... 
#
overview*overview_gvscmp_pop:  Overview help for the GVS/CMP Menu...\n\
\n\
This is the menu that lets you specify the Display and Plot Parameters\n\
for both the GVS and CMP displays.  The only constraints that are forced\n\
on the user are that both the GVS and the CMP displays must have the\n\
same Inches or Centimeters per second, the same ct, and the same tmin\n\
and tmax.  All other parameters can be specified seperately for each\n\
data type.  This menu also lets you setup seperate do/skip loops for\n\
displaying both types of data.
#
#   Overview help for the Semblance Menu...
#
overview*overview_sempop:  Overview help for the Semblance Menu...\n\
\n\
This is the menu that lets you specify the Color Selection and the\n\
Semblance Plot Parameters for your Semblance Velocity Display.  Valid\n\
Intellegent defaults are pre-determined and set from the input Semblance\n\
data file.  The Inches or Centemeters per second parameter is\n\
pre-set to agree with the GVS/CMP settings, however if these data sets\n\
are not read in, the default value is 2.  The pdmin and pdmax parameters\n\
are also consistant with the VELC and SVA programs.  If the default values\n\
are not satisfactory, be sure that you specify values that are valid\n\
within the limits of your input data file when appropriate. 
#
#   Overview help for the Iso Velocity Menu...
#
overview*overview_isopop:  Overview help for the Iso Velocity Menu...\n\
\n\
This is the menu that lets you specify the Color Selection and the\n\
Iso Velocity Plot Parameters for your Iso Velocity Display.  Valid\n\
Intellegent default display parameters are pre-determined and set from\n\
the input .vel velocity file if one is input.\n\
\n\
This menu also allows you to choose the Plot Type to display in\n\
the Iso Velocity display window.  To choose a type other than the\n\
default NMO versus 2-way Travl Time, simply point and click on the\n\
radio button that corresponds to the display you would like to see.
#
#   Overview help for the Iso Velocity Menu...
#
overview*overview_moviepop:  Overview help for the Movie Menu...\n\
\n\
This is the menu that lets you setup your GVS/CVST movie loop.\n\
Currently the GVS window is the only window in the VA program that\n\
allows you to setup and run a movie.  When the GVS/CVST data file\n\
is read in, valid default values are pre-set from the data for the\n\
First Panel to use and the Total # of Panels parameters.\n\
\n\
Once you have specified the movie parameters, or have decided to\n\
accept the default parameters, you must point and click mouse button #1\n\
on either the OK or the Apply Pushbuttons at the bottom of this menu\n\
in order to turn on the movie option.
#
#   Overview help for the Read (Second) Velocity File Dialog box...
#
overview*READ_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to read in a velocity File.  When\n\
a new file is read in using this option, it will either REPLACE the\n\
velocity functions that are currently in memory (in the active dataset),\n\
or ADD TO the velocity functions that are in memory (in the active dataset),\n\
or put the velocity functions into a NEW COMPARISON dataset.  This is\n\
dependant upon which option is selected on this dialog box.\n\
#
#   Overview help for the Active Velocity Function Dialog Box...
#
overview*PICK_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to build or edit any type of velocity\n\
function from the keyboard.  You can enter time, depth, or layer thickness\n\
versus NMO VEL, RMS VEL, AV VEL, OR INT VEL.  You can set a starting\n\
velocity and location, or add and change many other informational items\n\
associated with the active function on this menu.\n\
\n\
On this dialog box, one of these three columns is an independent variable:\n\
   depth     (depth of the velocity function pick)\n\
   time      (2-way time of the velocity function pick)\n\
   thickness (thickness of the layer just above this velocity function pick)\n\
\n\
Also, one of these four columns is an independent variable:\n\
   NMO VEL  (NMO or stacking velocity)\n\
   RMS VEL  (RMS or root-mean-square velocity)\n\
   AV VEL   (average velocity)\n\
   INT VEL  (interval velocity)\n\
\n\
As you enter a pair of values in the active fields of the table, the\n\
other values on the same line and in the inactive fields are automatically\n\
calculated for you.  What you enter is controlled by the type of function\n\
you desire to build.  This also means that a velocity function type\n\
gets changed when you change the columns used while building or editing \n\
the active velocity function.  When you are finished working with a\n\
function, you should always check to be sure that the type is set to\n\
what you desire.  This is important only if you save the functions to a\n\
file using the "mixed types" option.\n\
\n\
This menu also lets you invoke ray-tracing and easily move to the\n\
previous or next velocity function.\n\
\n\
Additional help explaining traversing the table using the keyboard\n\
is available by depressing the Help On Keys button at the bottom of\n\
this dialog box. 
#
#   Overview help for the List of Velocity Functions Dialog Box...
#
overview*FUN_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to edit your List of Velocity Functions.\n\
With this dialog box, you can choose the active function, insert locations\n\
delete locations, select locations, select the TYPE of velocity function\n\
and edit any of the header information associated with any function.\n\
\n\
Status information is also available on this dialog box concerning which\n\
functions have errors, how many picks are on each function, and which\n\
functions have been raytraced.\n\
\n\
Additional help explaining traversing the table using the keyboard, and\n\
inserting and deleting functions is available by depressing the Help On\n\
Keys button at the bottom of this dialog box.
#
#   Overview help for the Set Selected Function Types Dialog Box...
#
overview*TYPES_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to change the function type for all functions,\n\
selected functions, or only the active function.\n\
\n\
Since all velocity types have already been calculated and are stored in\n\
memory, changing velocity types does not re-calculate any of the velocities.\n\
The velocity function types determine what is saved on a velocity file\n\
when the "mixed types" option is chosen when you save a file.\n\
A velocity function type gets changed when you change the columns\n\
used while editing the active velocity function.
#
#   Overview help for the Set Selected Function Names Dialog Box...
#
overview*NAMES_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to easily change the function names for all\n\
functions, selected functions, or only the active function.\n\
\n\
With this dialog box, the names can be reset to a prefix plus either a\n\
counter or the X location, or just the Y plus X location as the name.
#
#   Overview help for the Transform Velocity Function Coordinates Dialog Box...
#
overview*COORDS_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to easily change the (X,Y) coordinates for all\n\
functions, selected functions, or only the active function.\n\
\n\
If you wish to convert the coordinates from an old CPS grid system to a\n\
new CPS grid system, you should take the following steps:\n\
    (1) Type in the old grid transform.\n\
    (2) Do a reverse transformation to return to the original survey system.\n\
    (3) Type in the new grid transform.\n\
    (4) Do a forward transformation to go to the new grid system.\n\
In principle, you could do both transforms in one step, but you probably\n\
would not know what values to type into the transform.\n\
\n\
If you wish to convert the coordinates in any other fashion, you can type\n\
in any transform you wish, although it might take some experimentation.\n\
You can use either a forward or reverse transform, depending on the values\n\
you choose to type in.  An example might be to convert between a grid\n\
system (using header words 7 and 8) and an annotation system (using header\n\
words 37 and 38).\n\
\n\
Remember you can always use the Undo button!  Following a forward transform\n\
by a reverse transform using the same values (or vice versa) is equivalent\n\
to pressing the Undo button (except for roundoff errors).\n\
\n\
If you wish to integerize the coordinates, you can do so with the third\n\
option supplied.  This option does not use the coordinate transform.\n\
\n\
If you wish to swap the X and Y coordinates, you can do so with the fourth\n\
or fifth option supplied.  The fifth option also swaps the X and Y header\n\
words (which also can be swapped manually on the list of velocity functions\n\
popup).  These two options also do not use the coordinate transform.\n\
\n\
It might be a good idea to use the grid plot, and the list of velocity\n\
functions popup, to help evaluate your efforts.
#
#   Overview help for the Set Selected Function Headers Dialog Box...
#
overview*HEADERS_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to easily change the function headers for all\n\
functions, selected functions, or only the active function.\n\
\n\
Any settings that you make on this dialog box will become the defaults\n\
for new functions and cleared velocity functions.
#
#   Overview help for Resample Selected Functions Vertically Dialog Box...
#
overview*RESAMPLE_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to vertically resample all functions, selected\n\
functions, or only the active function.\n\
\n\
With this dialog box, you can pick the type of function to resample, the\n\
resampling method to use, and the interpolation/smoothing method that you\n\
desire to use. 
#
#   Overview help for Resample Selected Functions Laterally Dialog Box...
#
overview*LATSAMPLE_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to laterally resample all velocity functions.\n\
\n\
You must have the same number of picks in each function before you can\n\
resample laterally.  Therefore, you might have to resample in the vertical\n\
direction first.\n\
\n\
With this dialog box, you can pick the type of function to resample, the\n\
resampling method to use, and the interpolation/smoothing method that you\n\
desire to use.\n\
\n\
This lateral resampling method does resampling and/or smoothing along lines\n\
in the X or Y direction, and then optionally in the other direction.\n\
This lateral resampling method will either modify the functions in place,\n\
or replace them with a regularized grid.\n\
\n\
The bin centers and bin widths (in the Set Tolerances dialog box) are used\n\
to determine which velocity functions reside on each line.
#
#   Overview help for Resample Selected Functions Laterally Dialog Box...
#
overview*NEARSAMPLE_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to laterally resample all velocity functions.\n\
\n\
With this dialog box, you can pick the type of function to resample and\n\
the grid of output locations to resample to.\n\
\n\
This lateral resampling method does resampling to a regularized rectangular\n\
grid by interpolating each new function from the nearest four existing\n\
functions (one in each of four quadrants from the new function's location).\n\
\n\
You do not have to have the same number of picks in each function before\n\
you can resample laterally using this resampling method.  The time/depth\n\
picks in each resampled velocity function will be either the times/depths\n\
in the nearest existing function, or a union of all the picks in the (up to)\n\
four nearest existing functions, depending on your choice.\n\
\n\
If you want all velocity functions to have the same time/depth picks,\n\
you can resample them vertically first.\n\
\n\
The bin centers and bin widths (in the Set Tolerances dialog box) are NOT\n\
used in this resampling option.
#
#   Overview help for the Raytrace Selected Functions Dialog Box...
#
overview*RAYTRACE_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to easily raytrace either selected velocity\n\
functions, raytrace all velocity functions, or only raytrace the active\n\
velocity function.\n\
\n\
With this dialog box you are also allowed to Reset NMO velocities equal to\n\
RMS velocities or, Reset RMS velocities equal to NMO velocities.\n\
\n\
If you select the raytracing option, and you have very many functions,\n\
raytracing will take awhile.
#
#   Overview help for the Delete Selected Functions Dialog Box...
#
overview*DELETE_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to easily delete either selected velocity\n\
functions, delete all velocity functions, or delete only the active\n\
function.
#
#   Overview help for the Miscellaneous Actions Dialog Box...
#
overview*MISC_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to convert to feet from meters or from\n\
meters to feet.  It also has an option that will let you easily\n\
create a velocity function for use with cascaded migration by letting\n\
you remove water velocity from a function.\n\
\n\
If changing units, you need to make sure any keyboard entries are\n\
in the right units. 
#
#   Overview help for the Offsets and Mutes (for ray tracing) dialog Box...
# 
overview*MUTE_OVERVIEW:\
This dialog box allows you to test and control the Offsets and Mute Times\n\
used during raytracing.  You can specify the minimum offset and the maximum\n\
offsets to use during raytracing, and specify the mute in several different\n\
ways.  You can also change the units of your mute on this menu.\n\
\n\
If the "Immediate action" togglebutton is depressed, any change made in\n\
this dialog box will immediately trigger raytracing of the active velocity\n\
function, but only if the "Active Velocity Function" dialog box is\n\
currently being displayed, and if its "Invoke ray tracing" togglebutton\n\
is also depressed.
#
#   Overview help for the Control Panel
#
overview*overview_cntlpop:  Overview help for the Control Panel...\n\
\n\
The Control Panel is seperated into two section; the Actions section\n\
where you can perform various actions on the data, and the Overlays\n\
section where the overlay functions are controled.\n\
\n\
                            Actions\n\
\n\
The Actions available on the control Panel include the following:\n\
\n\
   o  Displaying or removing the CMP Hyperbola overplots.\n\
   o  Involking Ray tracing on the Active function.\n\
   o  Enabling a Cross-hair to help you track your locations.\n\
   o  Applying and removing a display of the Doopler Mute.\n\
   o  Setting the Doppler Mute Factor.\n\
   o  Refreshing the Iso-Velocity Display.\n\

\n\
When you specify your input data for the Semblance, CMP, and\n\
GVS files, a CPS Byte file format is assumed, however the\n\
program can also read an IEEE format..  The IEEE format is\n\
the output from the CPS NDSKO program.  Files with this\n\
floating point format or BYTE files can easily be downloaded\n\
from the CRAY, across the network to any platform.\n\
\n\
The I/O routines of VA are smart enough to decode the file and\n\
and read the file in without you specifying any other information\n\
other than the filename.

#
# The Filename to read...
#
help*read_data_1 :  The Filename to read... pushbutton\n\
\n\
To read in your data, the first step is to specify a file.\n\
This can be done one of two ways.  By clicking mouse button\n\
#1 on the Filename to read... pushbutton, you can access the\n\
file selection pop-up menu.  Or, if the Filename to read...\n\
pushbutton is highlighted (focused), you can hit the Tab key.\n\
If you hit the Tab key, the focus will move to the box below\n\
where you can key in the pathname and filename.  If this\n\
information is not known, and you want to move back to the\n\
Filename to read... pushbutton, either move the mouse pointer\n\
to the pushbutton on the left where the words "Filename to\n\
read..." is written and click mouse button #1, or use the Shift\n\
Tab key combination to move to this pushbutton.\n\
\n\
The file selection pop-up menu allows you to easily search\n\
through your directories and files to find and select the\n\
file that you are wanting to read in.  The filter option on\n\
this pop-up is a powerful tool that allows you to use wild\n\
card annotation to help you search.  Items are selected from\n\
this menu by simply pointing the mouse pointer at the\n\
appropriate item and clicking mouse button #1.\n\
\n\
The filter option is used by typing in the desired information\n\
to search on in the Filter field and then clicking mouse\n\
button #1 on the Filter pushbutton.  Once a file has been\n\
selected, simply point and click on the word OK, and the\n\
pathname and filename will automatically be written into\n\
the field below the Filename to read... pushbutton on the\n\
Read (Second) Velocity File menu, as if you had keyed it in\n\
yourself.\n\
#
#  Velocity filename...
#
help*read_data_2:  Enter the path name and file name containing\n\
data to be read in.  If this information is not known,\n\
either move the mouse pointer to the pushbutton above where\n\
the words Filename to read... are written and click button #1 or\n\
use the Shift Tab key combination to move to this pushbutton,\n\
and then click mouse button #1.  This will bring up a file\n\
selection pop-up menu from which you can choose your file.
#
#   AutoSave Help
# 
help*bottom_inside.button_autosave:  AutoSave Help...\n\
\n\
While the autosave toggle is depressed, a velocity workfile will be\n\
automatically saved at various times during your session.  The name\n\
of this workfile is derived from the name of the latest velocity\n\
file read in (when not adding to previous data), and is guaranteed\n\
to be a non-existing file in the local directory.  While this toggle\n\
is depressed, the workfile will be saved (if changes have been made\n\
since the last save) at the following times:\n\
 - when you depress the toggle;\n\
 - each time you change to a different active velocity function;\n\
 - just before you read in a velocity file (replacing previous\n\
   data);\n\
 - just after you read in a velocity file (adding to previous data);\n\
 - just after major actions are performed (e.g. resample, delete,\n\
   undo);\n\
 - just before you quit;\n\
 - a number of other times.\n\
This protects you from inadvertently failing to save your work,\n\
or from computer crashes.  You can read a workfile in at any time\n\
by specifying the .work extension.  The automatic-save workfile\n\
will be deleted after YOU explicitly save all of your data onto a\n\
CPS velocity file, or onto another workfile, but will be re-created\n\
if you start making more changes.

The ct parameter is defined as the number of channels\n\
per trace.  When you plot your data Normalized, this \n\
parameter controls the maximum deviation of the largest\n\
amplitude on the trace.  When you plot you data without\n\
Normalizing it, this parameter controls the maximum\n\
deviation of the largest deviation in the file.\n\

    This is different than the batch program SPLT.\n\
    In SPLT for NORM=NO, this parameter controls the\n\
    maximum deviation of the largest deviation in the\n\
    plot.\n\

With your data Normalized, a ct=4 means that the largest\n\

NOTE:\n\
\n\
    A graphics screen has a fixed pixel resolution\n\
    similar to a plotter.  When plotting your data\n\
    on a graphics screen, you are dealing with this\n\
    limited resolution.  The quality of your plot can\n\
    depend upon resolution.  In other words, there is\n\
    a fixed Dots per Inch associated with any graphics\n\
    screen.  On the Tektronix XP29 X-Terminals this\n\
    resolution is 97 dots per inch even though the screen\n\
    resolution is 1280 X 1024 pixels.  On the Dec 19"\n\
    color monitors we get 99 dots per inch.  These dots\n\
    or pixels are a finite size and you cannot excite only\n\
    a part of a pixel with the electron beam.  When the\n\
    electron beam hits the pixel, the entire pixel is\n\
    excited.  Therefore, inches/sec or cm/sec and\n\
    Traces/inch or Traces/cm can only be an approximate\n\
    value.  You will find that if you have too small of\n\
    a Traces/inch or Traces/cm, or too large of a\n\
    inches/sec or cm/sec specified, your resolution\n\
    will be degraded.\n\

This field allows you to specify a velocity to begin your velocity\n\
functions at, at zero time.\n\
\n\
The values for (startvel), (timetol), and (depthtol) are all inter-related.\n\
The first pick at zero time or zero depth is handeled differently based\n\
on how the data is input.  This is because when a point is entered by hand,\n\
just one value at a time is input.  When a point is picked, both values\n\
are input at the same time.  Below is a description of each possible\n\
senerio.\n\
\n\

If you enter a velocity function by hand, and key in a velocity instead\n\
of a time or depth first, as an entry under NMO, RMS, AV, or INT, (startvel)\n\
will be ignored and the velocity you keyed in will automatically be placed\n\
at zero time.  You will not be allowed to edit this time but you may edit\n\
the velocity.\n\

be interactively input one of 13 ways.  These ways are:\n\
\n\
    o They can be picked using the mouse and button #1 from the\n\
      Semblance Velocity display.\n\
\n\
    o Any event can be traced from the CMP gather.  This action\n\
      translates into a time/NMO velocity pair.\n\

#
help*over_type.overint:  Interval Radiobutton...\n\
\n\
This radiobutton selects the velocity type that you wish to overlay and\n\
works in conjunction with the Overlay Picks togglebuttons above.  When you\n\
select Previous, Next, or Selected Function to overlay, you will also need\n\
to select the type of function to overlay.\n\
\n\
It is possible to overlay the Previous, Next, and a Selected Function all\n\
at the same time on top of the Semblance display, along with the current\n\
"Active" picks.  The only function that is editable is the "Active" function.\n\
\n\
Besides Interval, there are three other velocity types to choose from.  The\n\

#                  LOCATION SELECTION 
#
#    Select Slider Bar... 
#
help*selectscale.scale:  Select Slider bar...\n\
\n\
The purpose of this slider bar is to allow you to easily select\n\
any semblance location, based on the number of semblance locations\n\
available in your input semblance file.  When you first read in\n\
your semblance data, the first semblance location will automatically\n\
be displayed along with the corresponding CMP gather.  That is of\n\
course assuming that you also read in the CMP gathers.  If you also\n\
read in a GVS or CVST data set, the location of the current semblance\n\
panel will be indicated on this display by a blue line with the\n\
current picks displayed as "X's".  This line will be shown once you\n\
start picking the semblance panel.\n\
\n\
To select the next semblance location simply point and click on\n\
the arrow to the right of this slider bar.  When you do this, you\n\
will notice that a togglebutton at the bottom of the main VA display\n\
window will immediately turn green.  You will also notice that\n\
the slider bar moved to the right and incremented one value.  To\n\
read in the next semblance location simply point and click on the\n\
green "View Select" togglebutton.  When your next location is\n\
displayed, you will notice that the View Select button is no longer\n\
green.\n\
\n\
You can move to any semblance location in your semblance file by\n\
grabbing the slider bar with the mouse pointer and moving the\n\
pointer to the semblance location or by clicking the appropriate\n\
number of times on the left or right arrows.  As soon as you move\n\
the slider bar or click on one of the arrows, the "View Select"\n\
togglebutton will turn green.   You can go to the location indicated\n\
by the number above the slider bar by simply pointing and clicking\n\
on the View Select button.

#           Wbox_help                    revised  4 February 1993

#  Help for windowboxes (data entry windows created using the wbox
routines
#  on library wboxlib.a).

#  The contents of this file should be included in the application's
#  context-sensitive help file.  Overview help on keys is displayed
#  whenever the user presses CTRL-HELP or CTRL-F1 or CTRL-PF1.
#  Context-sensitive help is optionally displayed when the user's
pointer
#  gets into the general message area or the array index area at the
bottom
#  of the windowbox.  Context-sensitive help is also displayed for the
#  transient data fields used for finding an array index or an array
value.

#  You should also include context-sensitive help in this file, for all
#  data fields in your windowbox (except prompt names or other fields
#  with switch variable zero).  To do this, use identifiers typed as
#  follows:
#                        help*boxname_ident:
#
#  where boxname = the name specified in the call to wbox_create2 or
#                    fbox_create2,
#    and ident   = the identification integer specified in the
#                    registration call for the variable.
#
#    (Help can also be displayed for prompts associated with a variable,
#    if the switch variable for the prompt is not zero.  In this case,
#    the identification integer is the negative of that for the
variable.)


help*wbox_find_index:\
----------------------ARRAY INDEX TO
FIND-----------------------------\n\
Type here the array index you wish to go to.  The array (or arrays)\n\
will be scrolled if necessary.  If you just press RETURN or another

right,\n\
where you will be able to choose an array value rather than an array
index.


help*wbox_find_value:\
----------------------ARRAY VALUE TO
FIND-----------------------------\n\
Type here the array value you wish to go to.  The array (or arrays)\n\
will be scrolled if necessary.  If the array is a numeric array, you
will\n\
go to the nearest value in the array.  If the array is a character
string\n\
array, you will go the the value for which there is the greatest

is telling the program to go to the next velocity function.\n\
When this action occurs all displays will reflectthis change\n\
and the corresponding data will be input and displayed on the\n\
Semblance and CMP plot.  
#
#   AutoSave Help
# 
overview*button_autosave:  AutoSave Help...\n\
\n\
While the autosave toggle is depressed, a velocity workfile will be\n\
automatically saved at various times during your session.  The name\n\
of this workfile is derived from the name of the latest velocity\n\
file read in (when not adding to previous data), and is guaranteed\n\
to be a non-existing file in the local directory.  While this toggle\n\
is depressed, the workfile will be saved (if changes have been made\n\
since the last save) at the following times:\n\
 - when you depress the toggle;\n\
 - each time you change to a different active velocity function;\n\
 - just before you read in a velocity file (replacing previous\n\
   data);\n\
 - just after you read in a velocity file (adding to previous data);\n\
 - just after major actions are performed (e.g. resample, delete,\n\
   undo);\n\
 - just before you quit;\n\
 - a number of other times.\n\
This protects you from inadvertently failing to save your work,\n\
or from computer crashes.  You can read a workfile in at any time\n\
by specifying the .work extension.  The automatic-save workfile\n\
will be deleted after YOU explicitly save all of your data onto a\n\
CPS velocity file, or onto another workfile, but will be re-created\n\
if you start making more changes.




overview*HORIZON_READ_OVERVIEW:    \
\n\
To read this horizon file properly, you probably will have to change the\n\
code to properly identify the columns of numbers in the file.\n\
\n\
You should first identify the columns containing the following values:\n\
  (1) the X coordinate (which you will identify with the label X).\n\
  (2) the Y coordinate (which you will identify with the label Y).\n\
  (3) the picked time  (which you will identify with the label T or M).\n\
  (4) the shotpoint    (which you will identify with the label S).\n\
  (5) the line number  (which you will identify with the label L).\n\
\n\
There are two ways to specify the code:\n\
  (1) Simply type the five column identifiers X,Y,T,S,L in the correct order.\n\
        If any columns are to be skipped, type - for that column.\n\
        Columns falling after the five required columns do not have to be\n\
        identified with the - identifier.\n\
  (2) If some columns are run together (without white space between the\n\
        columns), or if extraneous unwanted information exists which might\n\
        contain different numbers of spaces on different lines, you can type\n\
        each identifier repeatedly over the width of each column containing\n\
        the correct value.  It is not necessary in this case to type\n\
        the skip identifier - over unwanted columns.\n\
\n\
You can use either upper or lower case.\n\
You should use M rather than T if the times are in milliseconds rather\n\
  than seconds.\n\
You do not need to read in every one of the five columns mentioned above.\n\
  For example, if the file does not contain line numbers, do not use L.\n\
  Any column not read in will contain all nil values.\n\
\n\
If you accidentally read in a file with the wrong code, all you need to do\n\
is to visit the "View Horizons" dialog box, make the bad file the active\n\
file, delete the active file, correct the code, and try again to read the\n\
file.\n\





 
#          Make_plots_help               revised 14 April 1993

#  Help for make_plots.c

#  The contents of this file should be included in the application's
#  context-sensitive help file.

#  You should also include context-sensitive help in this file, for the
#  two pushbuttons in each plot.  To do this, use identifiers typed as
#  follows:
#                        help*XXXX*mp_xlabel:
#                        help*XXXX*mp_ylabel:
#
#  where XXXX = the name specified in the call to make_plot.
# 
 
help*mp_draw:\
----------------------GRAPH MANIPULATION-------------------------------\n\
You can press mouse button 2 to toggle between two methods for labelling\n\
the x and y axes.  The default method uses evenly-spaced labels with\n\
nice values, and the other method uses the exact values in the arrays\n\
that are plotted against each other.\n\
                         -----------------\n\
You can press the two pushbuttons below to cycle among various arrays\n\
to plot on each axis.

---------------------------DEFINITIONS--------------------------------\n\
\n\
A WINDOWBOX is a special rectangular area in a Motif dialog box or main\n\
   window.  This rectangular area, outlined with a 5-pixel-wide black\n\
   border, is used primarily for displaying and editing arrays of numbers.\n\
   This help describes common features of all windowboxes.  A windowbox\n\
   contains one or more datafield groups, each of which contains one or\n\
   more datafields. It also displays one or two message lines at the bottom.\n\
   One or more windowboxes, and possibly text fields or buttons which\n\
   are not part of any windowbox, may reside in the same dialog box or\n\
   main window.  The buttons along the bottom of a dialog box are not part\n\
   of any windowbox.\n\
\n\
A DATAFIELD is an individual text field (into which the user might be able\n\
   to enter text or numbers), or a pushbutton, a toggle button, or a radio\n\
   button.  These text fields and buttons look and behave similarly to\n\
   Motif widgets.\n\
\n\
A DATAFIELD GROUP is either a set of linked arrays, or the set of all\n\
   datafields which are not part of any array.  It is similar to a\n\
   Motif "tab group".\n\
\n\
A SET OF LINKED ARRAYS consists of one or more side-by-side columns of\n\
   datafields, where each column is an array.  All arrays in such a set\n\
   always have the same number of array elements.  These arrays can be\n\
   scrolled together (using a scrollbar or special keys) to bring into view\n\
   all elements of the arrays.\n\
\n\
----------------------MOVING FROM FIELD TO FIELD----------------------\n\
\n\
Use mouse button 1 to move to any datafield.  It can also be used to\n\
scroll a set of linked arrays using the normal actions of a scrollbar.\n\
\n\
Use ARROW keys to move up, down, left, or right to adjacent datafields\n\
within the same datafield group.  Arrays will scroll as necessary.\n\
The ENTER key will do the same thing as the last ARROW key used.\n\
\n\
Use TAB or SHIFT-TAB to move into or out of the windowbox to/from other\n\
parts of the dialog box.  This is a standard Motif action.\n\
\n\
Use TAB or SHIFT-TAB or F20 or SHIFT-F20 or CTRL-T to move from one\n\
datafield group to another within the windowbox.\n\
\n\
  [For keymode 2 (see CTRL-S below), you must use TAB and SHIFT-TAB\n\
  (instead of LEFT and RIGHT) to move left or right to adjacent datafields\n\
  within a datafield group, rather than from one datafield group to another.]\n\
\n\
  [Keymode 3 disables the use of TAB and SHIFT-TAB for any purpose within\n\
  the windowbox because of the Motif action which may also occur.]\n\
\n\
Use CTRL-ARROW or SHIFT-CTRL-ARROW to move to top, bottom, left edge, or\n\
right edge within a datafield group.  In arrays, the SHIFT-CTRL-UP and\n\
SHIFT-CTRL-DOWN keys cause movement to the very beginning or end of the\n\
arrays (scrolling as necessary), whereas the CTRL-UP (or PREV) and\n\
CTRL-DOWN (or NEXT) keys scroll one screen-full at a time.\n\
\n\
------------------EDITING WITHIN A TEXT DATA FIELD--------------------\n\
\n\
Use mouse button 1 to move within a text datafield, and to change between\n\
replace, insert, and overstrike text entry modes.  The current mode is\n\
shown in a message area at the bottom.  For replace and overstrike modes,\n\
highlighted text will be replaced when the next printable key is pressed.\n\
For insert mode, text pushed off the right is lost.\n\
\n\
Alternately, use SHIFT-LEFT and SHIFT-RIGHT to move within a text datafield.\n\
     [For keymode 2 (see CTRL-S below), you can also use LEFT and RIGHT\n\
     for this purpose.]\n\
\n\
Alternately, use SHIFT-UP or SHIFT-DOWN to change between replace, insert,\n\
and overstrike text entry modes.\n\
\n\
Use the DELETE key to delete a character to the left of the curser. \n\
If all characters are deleted, the previous value reappears.\n\
\n\
-------------------MISCELLANEOUS SPECIAL ACTION KEYS------------------\n\
\n\
Use mouse button 1 (or RETURN or SELECT) to activate the highlighted\n\
     pushbutton or toggle button or radio button.\n\
Use DO (or CTRL-D) to undo the most recently typed value, and to toggle\n\
     between the last two values.\n\
Use HELP (or PF1 or F1) to activate context-sensitive help, which will be\n\
     displayed for each field as it becomes active, and for all fields swept \n\
     over by the pointer (with or without holding down a mouse button).\n\
Use CTRL-HELP (or CTRL-PF1 or CTRL-F1) to get this help on keys.\n\
Use CTRL-[an integer] to choose a debug mode (same as resource wboxdebug).\n\
\n\
-----------------SPECIAL OPTIONS WITHIN ARRAY FIELDS------------------\n\
\n\
Use FIND (or CTRL-F) to go to a desired index or value in the current column.\n\
     The closest match will be found.\n\
Use CTRL-M to find the next matching value in the current column.\n\
Use CTRL-N to find the next non-matching value in the current column.\n\
Use CTRL-V to find ANY value which matches ANY OTHER in the current column.\n\
Use REMOVE (or CTRL-R) to remove a row and put it into the row-buffer.\n\
Use INSERT (or CTRL-I) to insert a row from the row-buffer.\n\
     If the row-buffer is empty, or contains a row from a different set of\n\
     linked arrays, or the array index of the current row does not match\n\
     the array index previously saved, the inserted row is set to nils.\n\
Use CTRL-P (paste) like INSERT, except the current row does not have to\n\
     match the saved row.  This enables moving rows from one row to another.\n\
Use CTRL-C (clear) to clear the row-buffer to nils.\n\
The current index, and the maximum current number of indices, are shown \n\
     in a message area at the bottom.\n\
You can resize this dialog box by grabbing its border with the mouse, to \n\
     increase or decrease the number of rows and columns visible.  This is \n\
     particularly useful when you have a long set of linked arrays, or a \n\
     bunch of columns on the right which are not currently needed. \n\
In some applications, the keys for inserting and removing rows might work\n\
     slightly differently from the above description.\n\
\n\
---------------ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO USE ARROW AND TAB KEYS--------------\n\
\n\
Use CTRL-S (referred to above) to toggle between three keymodes for using\n\
   arrow and tab keys (corresponding to values of the resource wboxkeymode):\n\
\n\
wboxkeymode 1 (most similar to EZED, and to Motif style for buttons):      \n\
  to move within a datafield:        SHIFT-LEFT   SHIFT-RIGHT              \n\
  to move to another datafield:      LEFT         RIGHT                    \n\
  to move between datafield groups:  F20  SHIFT-F20  CTRL-T  TAB  SHIFT-TAB\n\
\n\
wboxkeymode 2 (most similar to Motif style for text):                      \n\
  to move within a datafield:         SHIFT-LEFT  SHIFT-RIGHT  LEFT  RIGHT \n\
  to move to another datafield:       TAB   SHIFT-TAB                      \n\
  to move between datafield groups:   F20   SHIFT-F20   CTRL-T             \n\
\n\
wboxkeymode 3 (reduces conflict between windowboxes and Motif):            \n\
  to move within a datafield:         SHIFT-LEFT   SHIFT-RIGHT             \n\
  to move to another datafield:       LEFT         RIGHT                   \n\
  to move between datafield groups:   F20   SHIFT-F20   CTRL-T             \n\
\n\
----------------------------RESOURCES---------------------------------\n\
\n\
The following resource be set for tables in an app-defaults file,\n\
or in your own .Xdefaults table.  The examples shown are commonly-\n\
used defaults (although not necessarily the defaults in this program).\n\
\n\
The font resource and color resources may have to be customized for\n\
different X-window servers and for individual preferences.\n\
On gray-scale monitors, the colors automatically change to shades of gray.\n\
On black-white monitors, the colors automatically change to black or white.\n\
\n\
To change any resource, just add lines like these examples to your\n\
.Xdefaults file in your home directory, and then load the file into\n\
your server by typing xrdb .Xdefaults.  (The information in parentheses\n\
should not be typed.)\n\

overview*DATABOX_HARDCOPY:\
Press OK to save the contents of this table to a file.\n\
Press Cancel if you decide NOT to save this table to a file.\n\
\n\
If you do not like the default filename, change it.  If you do not\n\
type an extension, the extension ".hardcopy" will be added for you.\n\
\n\
The following information is saved to the file:\n\
(1) An image of the visible table area (inside the dark black square).\n\
(2) The full listing of all scrollable arrays in the table.\n\
\n\
It is possible to get an extremely large file if the scrollable\n\
arrays are long.  For this reason, the approximate length of the\n\
file is shown.\n\
\n\
After this file is saved, it can be edited with a text editor,\n\
printed, and/or processed by awk or another program.\n\
\n\



overview*overview_Eta_Gui:\
  This is a beta ETA capability. Currently this option does not update\n\
VA's normal velocity file. To date our current velocity\n\
file format does not support a field for the ETA values. This option\n\
will write out a separate velocity file in VTIN. \n\
  You may switch between normal semblance velocity picking and ETA picking\n\
by mouse button 3. When in this mode you pick the location on the semblance\n\
and a display of the ETA will appear from which you can make your ETA pick.\n\
You should see a white dashed line on the semblance indicating the times\n\
at which you have picked an ETA value. Note that currently the output ETA\n\
file automatically saves itself. There are many improvements planned but\n\
we must wait until this capability can be better integrated into VA as \n\
the velocity file format evolves.\n\
  NOTE: Eta picking will modify your normal nmo velocity depending on\n\
where in the vnmo plane you make your eta pick.\n\
\n\

help*vel_intchoice.file:  ETA velocity file input...\n\
\n\
 Input the velocity file containing your previous ETA picks.\n\
NOTE: CURRENTLY THESE PICKS WILL OVERWRITE ANY THAT MAY ALREADY\n\
BE IN MEMORY !

help*vel_outchoice.file:  ETA velocity file output...\n\
\n\
 Output velocity file containing your ETA picks.\n\
Currently this file will be written automatically.

help*eta_params_box.window_length: Window Length...\n\
  Window length for semblance calculation in seconds.


help*eta_params_box.nmo_velocity_width: Nmo Velocity Width...\n\
  Specifies the nmo velocity width. If you used a width of 1000\n\
and picked on the semblance at 2000 your ETA display will cover\n\
the nmo velocity range of 1500 to 2500.


help*eta_params_box.nmo_velocity_increment: Nmo Velocity Increment...\n\
  The increment of the velocity scans within the nmo velocity width\n\
you specified.


help*eta_params_box.horz_velocity_width: Horizontal Velocity Width...\n\
  Specifies the horizontal velocity. If you used a width of 1000\n\
and picked on the semblance at 2000 you ETA display will cover\n\
the horizontal range of 1500 to 2500.

help*eta_params_box.horz_velocity_increment: Horizontal Velocity Increment...\n\
  The increment of the velocity scans within the horizontal velocity width\n\
you specified.


help*eta_params_box.connum: Number of contours...\n\
  The number of contours to render the image.

help*eta_params_box.pwidth: Plot Width...\n\
  The width in inches to render the image.


help*eta_params_box.pheight: Plot Height...\n\
  The height in inches to render the image.
