                COMPARE_AND_COPY_PROCEDURES              2004-06-02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To compare local files with those in ~spws and ~sps system directories:
#
#                        compare  <code>
#
#  <code> = all      prints a line for each file.
#  <code> = matching prints a line for each matching file only.
#  <code> = missing  prints a line for each missing file only.
#  <code> = diff     prints a line for each non-matching file only.
#  <code> = mgdiff   prints a line for each non-matching file only.
#  <code> = xdiff    prints a line for each non-matching file only.
#  <code> = default  prints a line for each non-matching file only (default).
#  <code> = reverse  prints a line for each non-matching file in reverse order.
#  <code> = multiple prints a line for each file found more than once.
#  <code> = help     prints help.
#
# The user can then do a diff or mgdiff or xdiff to see the details of files
# which differ.  This can be done simply by triple-clicking on a listed line
# and then button-2-clicking in another xterm.
#
# If a second command line argument is specified, it should be a directory
# to which the local files are compared, instead of the system directories.
#
# This script can be used in a developer's directory to compare local files
# with those in ~spws and ~sps.  This script can also be used in an ~spws
# directory to compare local files with those in ~sps and /usr/app/vendors/spws.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To copy a source file from ~spws to the user's local directory:
#
#                copy_from_spws  <filename>  <mode>
#
# where <filename> = desired source file (with extension but without path).
# where <mode>     = always or different or missing (default missing).
#
# This script looks in the include and programs and oop and util directories.
# This script adds user write permission to the copied file.
#
# If the system version of the file cannot be found:
#
#   If a local version exists, this script does nothing and exits normally.
#   If there is no local version, this script exits with an error message.
#
# If the system version of the file is found:
#
#   <mode> = always:  The file is always copied from the system, whether
#                     or not a local version exists.  If a local version
#                     exists, it is replaced by the system version.
#
#   <mode> = different:  The file is copied from the system only if a
#                        local version does not exist, or if the system
#                        version is different from the local version.
#
#   <mode> = missing (default):  The file is copied from the system only
#                                if a local version does not exist.
#
#   <mode> = newer:  The file is copied from the system only if a local
#                    version does not exist, or if the system version
#                    is newer than the local version.
