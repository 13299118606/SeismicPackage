           rcs_issues         UPDATE OPTION A         2004-05-21

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To create new ~spws source files (working in my own directory):

myself: (C1) Create and test my new source files.
myself: (C2) Verify that source files of the same name are not in ~spws.
spws:   (C3) Copy my new files from my directory to the ~spws directory.

spws:   (C4) Check the new files into RCS, and then check them out again
             read-only (unlocked) as follows:

               ci  -d  -u  -m'log message'  filename   (or use wildcard)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To update ~spws source files (working in my own directory):

myself: (U1) Copy the ~spws source files to my directory.
myself: (U2) Do a chmod u+w on my copies of the files so I can edit them.
myself: (U3) Update and test my copies of the files in my directory.

myself: (U4) Do a diff between my new copies and the ~spws copies to make
             sure the changes are only my own.  If there are any changes
             not my own, incorporate the changes in my new copies, then
             retest, then do a diff again.

spws:   (U5) Check out read-write (locked) copies from RCS (overwriting the
             read-only copies) as follows:

               co  -l  filename    (or use wildcard)

             Note that this step is dangerous because some overwritten files
             might be more recent updates than the latest versions in RCS.
             Therefore step (U4) must precede this step rather than follow it.

spws:   (U6) Copy my updated files from my directory to the ~spws directory
             (overwriting the read-write copies just checked out).

spws:   (U7) Check the updated files into RCS, and then check them out
             again as read-only (unlocked) as follows:

               ci  -u  -m'log message'  filename   (or use wildcard)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To update ~spws source files (working directly in ~spws):

spws:   (D1) Check out read-write (locked) copies from RCS (overwriting the
             read-only copies) as follows:

               co  -l  filenames    (or use wildcard)

             Note that this step is dangerous because some overwritten files
             might be more recent updates than the latest versions in RCS.
             Therefore, if any potentially overwritten files are read-write,
             the safe thing to do is to move them to temporary names before
             this step, and then move them back afterwards.

spws:   (D2) Update and test these copies of the files in the ~spws directory.

spws:   (D3) Check the updated files into RCS, and then check them out again
             as read-only (unlocked) as follows:

               ci  -u  -m'log message'  filename   (or use wildcard)
