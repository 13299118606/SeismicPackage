This is a working document.
The contents of this document need to be decided by all of us.
This is only my attempt to get things started so I will know how to do things.

Scripts to install on local architecture:

     gmake install   (runs install_spws_program)

     install_spws_program             <program>
     install_spws_script              <script>
     install_spws_links

Scripts to install on all architectures (these also tag the RCS files):

     install_spws_program_everywhere  <program>  (runs gmake install everywhere)
     install_spws_script_everywhere   <script>

File containing node and platform for each architecture:

     installation_locations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install an ~spws program everywhere:

     Run the following script on a node which supports RCS:

           install_spws_program_everywhere <program>

     where <program> is the name of the program executable.

     The above script performs the following tasks:

      (a) Calls tag_rcs_files_everywhere to tag all the latest
          versions of source code in all source code directories
          with the same date used by install_spws_program_everywhere
          to identify the installed programs.

      (b) Runs "gmake install" (which runs install_spws_program)
          on an appropriate node for each desired architecture.

     WARNING: All RCS directories must contain the latest versions
     of source files before running this script.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install an ~spws script everywhere:

     Run the following script on a node which supports RCS:

           install_spws_script_everywhere <script>

     where <script> is the name of the script to install.

     The above script performs the following tasks:

      (a) Tags the latest version of the script source code with the same
          date used by install_spws_script to identify the installed script.
 
      (b) Runs install_spws_script on an appropriate node for each desired
          architecture.
 
     WARNING: The relevant RCS directory must contain the latest version
     of the script being installed.
