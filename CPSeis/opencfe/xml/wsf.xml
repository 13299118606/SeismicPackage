<pre> Default = 0.0

 If MODE = INVERSE, then ANG_REF is the angle corresponding to the desired
 amount of wavelet stretch in your OUTPUT traces. Setting ANG_REF = 0.0 would
 attempt to remove wavelet stretch completely (since wavelets are unstretched
 at normal incidence). However, you may obtain better results by setting
 ANG_REF to an intermediate angle within the range of angles in your input
 data. In this way, although you won't remove stretch completely, WSF will at
 least try to adjust all wavelets to have the SAME amount of stretch.
 
 If MODE = FORWARD, then ANG_REF is the angle corresponding to the amount of
 wavelet stretch in your INPUT traces. (If you have synthetic angle-domain
 data in which all events simply have unstretched normal incidence wavelets,
 take the default ANG_REF = 0.0.)  WSF will then stretch all wavelets
 according to the angles found in header word 6 of each trace.</pre></head></html>]]></Text>

 ANG_WVLT should be the reflection angle of your estimated wavelet in file

<b><center>wsf - TIM_FIRST<br> Time of first sample in wavelet, in seconds.</center></b>
<pre> Default = 0.0 (or read from wavelet file)
 Allowed = real
 Time of first sample in wavelet is used for proper centering of the wavelet
 (as in wavelets used by DSIG and AVAGRAD). Normally, the value of TIM_FIRST
 should be negative, assuming that time zero is within the wavelet itself.
 
 The zero time of your wavelet defines the origin about which the wavelet
 will be stretched or unstretched. If your TIM_FIRST value isn't correct,
 output gathers from WSF will display spurious moveout, even if events were
 carefully flattened in the data input to WSF.
 
 As in the case of DSIG and AVAGRAD, the front end attempts to read the TMIN
 value from your wavelet file (if that file exists already when building the
 job containing WSF) and this value is taken as the default for TIM_FIRST;
 however, you may override this setting manually, if necessary.
 
 If your wavelet is in a SEGY file, the TMIN extracted from the file will
 always be 0.0 (because SEGY format doesn't support non-zero TMIN), so you'll
 have to know the correct TIM_FIRST value independently.  If you extracted
 your wavelet using interactive inversion software you probably determined
 its centering time quite accurately in the extraction process.  If your
 estimated wavelet was calculated by C4WE, the TMIN in your wavelet file is
 only very approximate; in this case, we recommend analyzing it with SPCT to
 determine a more accurate TIM_FIRST before using this wavelet in WSF (Note
 that the spectral analysis tools in SPCT are also available in Cbyt where
 you may run them interactively).</pre></head></html>]]></Text>

                          GENERAL DESCRIPTION
 
 Stretching of wavelets occurs in NMO correction as well as more sophisticated
 imaging processes such as prestack migrations which are intended to flatten
 events in prestack gathers. The amount of wavelet stretch varies according to
 the offset distance or reflection angle; consequently, wavelet stretch may
 lead to incorrect results in quantitative AVO/AVA analysis and prestack
 inversion. The problem is also known as "offset dependent tuning" because the
 increasing amounts of wavelet stretch at greater offsets/angles cause more
 overlap of nearby events in the data from those larger offsets/angles.
 
 A correction for offset dependent tuning has existed for several years in
 process AVAGRAD but is a special trick that only works when calculating AVO
 intercepts and gradients. The data reduction involved in intercept/gradient
 computation is sometimes unacceptable. For example, if we intend to do
 3-parameter prestack inversion, we cannot use AVAGRAD which reduces the data
 to two parameters, eliminating any hope of inverting for a third parameter.
 
 WSF corrects for wavelet stretch (or offset dependent tuning) in prestack
 data without reducing the data to AVO intercept and gradient. WSF is based on
 a new algorithm for which an ICR is currently being prepared. Description of
 the algorithm will be added to this documentation once the ICR has been
 submitted.
 
 WSF requires prestack input data in the domain of reflection angle instead of
 offset (In fact, header word 6 of the input traces must contain angle rather
 than offset). As an example, input data may consist of partial angle stacks
 produced by AVAST.  Like the offset dependent tuning correction in AVAGRAD,
 WSF requires an estimated wavelet which must have been saved in a disk
 file. Options are available for both inverse stretch correction and forward
 stretch modeling.

                            ADVICE FOR USERS
 
 
 More about Offset Dependent Tuning:
 
 Offset dependent tuning is not merely an artifact of wavelet stretch. Even
 in raw prestack gathers that haven't been flattened by NMO correction or
 other imaging processes, events follow non-parallel moveout curves which tend
 to converge at large offsets. Thus, although nothing has been done that would
 stretch the wavelets, nearby events overlap more at large offsets than at
 small offsets.
 
 As input for WSF, we consider data in which gathers HAVE been flattened by an
 imaging process which has also stretched the wavelets. And since WSF requires
 input in the angle domain, we work in that domain (with reflection angles in
 header word 6 of each trace). Thus, events include stretched wavelets, where
 the amount of stretching increases with increasing angle.
 
 
 Relationship to ODT Correction in AVAGRAD:
 
 WSF was intended largely as an alternative to the offset dependent tuning
 correction in AVAGRAD, for cases when it would not be appropriate to use
 AVAGRAD (for example, if we wish to attempt 3-parameter prestack inversion).
 Cascading of the wavelet stretch correction in WSF with the ODTC option in
 AVAGRAD will NOT give correct results. Thus, if you have already removed
 wavelet stretch using WSF, and you then wish to compute AVA intercepts and
 gradients, do NOT use the ODTC option in AVAGRAD.
 
 In fact, if your object is just to compute intercepts and gradients, you
 should get essentially the same results if you run WSF followed by AVAGRAD
 without ODTC, or if you don't use WSF and just run AVAGRAD with ODTC.
 (Actually, synthetic tests suggest that the FIRST method [using WSF instead
 of the ODTC option in AVAGRAD] produces better results, but we don't know yet
 if this will hold for real data.)
 
 
 Using WSF in Forward Modeling:
 
 Some forward modeling programs (including HSYN in CPS) can produce gathers
 with events that are perfectly flat but unrealistically contain the same
 wavelets at all offsets/angles. In such cases, WSF (using MODE = FORWARD)
 can be used to apply wavelet stretch, thereby simulating the stretching that
 would occur in normal seismic processing. The following sequences should
 produce comparable output, with similarly stretched wavelets:
 
 1)  HSYN(DOMAIN=X_T,MOVEOUT=HYPER)   -&gt;  NMO    -&gt;  AVAST
 2)  HSYN(DOMAIN=X_T,MOVEOUT=NONE)    -&gt;  AVAST  -&gt;  WSF(MODE=FORWARD)
 3)  HSYN(DOMAIN=ANGLE,MOVEOUT=NONE)  -&gt;  WSF(MODE=FORWARD)
 
 In sequence (1), HSYN produces x-t gathers with hyperbolic moveout; NMO
 flattens the gathers while stretching the wavelets; AVAST converts results
 to the angle domain. WSF is not used in this sequence.
 In sequence (2), HSYN produces x-t gathers with flat events with the same
 wavelets at all offsets; AVAST converts to the angle domain; then WSF
 stretches the wavelets.
 In sequence (3), HSYN produces angle gathers with flat events with the same
 wavelets at all angles; then WSF stretches the wavelets.
 
 In normal data processing, of course, our interest is to remove the wavelet
 stretching caused by NMO or other imaging processes; thus, we would use WSF
 with MODE = INVERSE.
 
 
 ANG_REF and ANG_WVLT parameters:
 
 When MODE = FORWARD, the defaults values ANG_REF = 0.0 and ANG_WVLT = 0.0
 are usually appropriate, as your input traces would normally consist of
 synthetic angle domain data (from a process such as HSYN) containing
 unstretched zero-angle wavelets, and you would also normally provide the
 zero-angle wavelet in file PATH_WVLT.
 
 When MODE = INVERSE, set ANG_REF to an angle matching the amount of stretch
 you want wavelets to have in your output traces. While you might ideally
 wish to remove wavelet stretch completely (by setting ANG_REF = 0.0), you
 may obtain better results by setting ANG_REF to an intermediate angle within
 the range of angles in your input data. In this way, although you won't
 remove stretch completely, WSF will at least try to adjust all wavelets to
 have the SAME amount of stretch.
 Your setting of ANG_WVLT should depend on how you obtained your estimated
 wavelet in file PATH_WVLT. For example, if you estimated the wavelet using a
 near-angle section with reflection angle 15 degrees, set ANG_WVLT = 15.
 
 
 Wavelet Centering:
 
 The TIM_FIRST parameter specifies the time of first sample of your wavelet
 and is used for proper centering of the wavelet (as in wavelets used by
 DSIG and AVAGRAD). Normally, the value of TIM_FIRST should be negative,
 assuming that time zero is within the wavelet itself.
 
 The zero time of your wavelet defines the origin about which the wavelet
 is stretched or unstretched. If your TIM_FIRST value isn't correct, output
 gathers from WSF will display spurious moveout, even if events were
 carefully flattened in the data input to WSF.
 
 As in the case of DSIG and AVAGRAD, the front end attempts to read the TMIN
 value from your wavelet file (if that file exists already when building the
 job containing WSF) and this value is taken as the default for TIM_FIRST;
 however, you may override this setting manually, if necessary.
 
 If your wavelet is in a SEGY file, the TMIN extracted from the file will
 always be 0.0 (because SEGY format doesn't support non-zero TMIN), so you'll
 have to know the correct TIM_FIRST value independently.  If you extracted
 your wavelet using interactive inversion software you probably determined
 its centering time quite accurately in the extraction process.  If your
 estimated wavelet was calculated by C4WE, the TMIN in your wavelet file is
 only very approximate; in this case, we recommend analyzing it with SPCT to
 determine a more accurate TIM_FIRST before using this wavelet in WSF (Note
 that the spectral analysis tools in SPCT are also available in Cbyt where
 you may run them interactively).
 
 
 Accompanying Bandpass Filter:
 
 Parameters FREQ_LOW_NONE, FREQ_LOW_FULL, FREQ_HIGH_FULL and FREQ_HIGH_NONE
 define an accompanying bandpass filter which may be needed to avoid noise
 build-up at some frequencies when MODE = INVERSE -- especially to avoid
 blowing up noise at higher frequencies in traces at larger angles.
 
 When MODE = FORWARD, you can probably set this bandpass filter be be wide
 open (FREQ_LOW_NONE = 0.0; FREQ_LOW_FULL = 0.0, FREQ_HIGH_FULL = Nyquist;
 FREQ_HIGH_NONE = Nyquist).
