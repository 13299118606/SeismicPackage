Contents of this directory are Matlab packages to perform the following
tasks.

NOLIN_Rp, Petr Jilek, (NOnLinear Inversion of Rp reflection coefficients) 
          package 

REFLCOEF, Petr Jilek, displacement reflection coefficients at a planar interface
          and reflectivity modeling for P incident on anisotropic media
          (up to monoclinic) having a horizontal symmetry plane.

LIN_Rp, Petr Jilek, joint linear inversion of approximate PP and PS wave 
          reflection coefficients: current version designed for 
          anisotropic media including isotropic, HTI, VTI,  and 
          orthorhombic symmetry.

Multi_Comp_Stack_Vel_Tomo, Vladimir Grechka and Andres Pech, joint 
	tomographic inversion of the NMO ellipses, reflection slopes, and
          zero-offset traveltimes of PP- and SS-waves.
